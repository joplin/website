This includes the discussion of issues on GitHub, as well as the submission of pull requests and related discussions. The transparency of these processes allows for collaborative problem-solving and shared insights.</p><p>However, there is one aspect that operates behind closed doors, and for good reason: addressing cybersecurity vulnerabilities. It is imperative that these issues remain undisclosed until they have been resolved. Once a solution is implemented, it is usually accompanied by discreet commits and a message in the changelog to signify the progress made.</p><p>Typically, the process begins with an email from a security researcher. They provide valuable insights, such as a specially crafted note that triggers a bug, or an API call, along with an explanation of how the application's security can be circumvented. We examine the vulnerability, create a fix, and create automated test units to prevent any accidental reintroduction of the vulnerability in future code updates. An example of such a commit is: <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/commit/9e90d9016daf79b5414646a93fd369aedb035071" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">9e90d9016daf79b5414646a93fd369aedb035071</a></p><p>We then share our fix with the researcher for validation. Additionally, we often apply the fix to previous versions of Joplin, depending on the severity of the vulnerability.</p><p>The contribution of security researchers in this regard is immeasurable. They employ their ingenuity to identify inventive methods of bypassing existing security measures and often discover subtle flaws in the code that might otherwise go unnoticed.</p><p>We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the security researchers who have assisted us throughout the years in identifying and rectifying security vulnerabilities!</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/a1ise" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Alise</a></li><li>@hexodotsh</li><li><a href="https://github.com/ly1g3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ly1g3</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/maple3142" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@maple3142</a></li><li>Ademar Nowasky Junior</li><li><a href="mailto:ben@mayhem.sg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Benjamin Harris</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/JavierOlmedo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Javier Olmedo</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/newfolderj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jubair Rehman Yousafzai</a></li><li>lin@UCCU Hacker</li><li><a href="https://github.com/personalizedrefrigerator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">personalizedrefrigerator</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/fhlipZero" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phil Holbrook</a></li><li><a href="https://ryotak.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RyotaK</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/YNizry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yaniv Nizry</a></li></ul><hr><p><a href="https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/33283" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fab" data-icon="discourse" class="svg-inline--fa fa-discourse fa-lg" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 448 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M225.9 32C103.3 32 0 130.5 0 252.1 0 256 .1 480 .1 480l225.8-.2c122.7 0 222.1-102.3 222.1-223.9C448 134.3 348.6 32 225.9 32zM224 384c-19.4 0-37.9-4.3-54.4-12.1L88.5 392l22.9-75c-9.8-18.1-15.4-38.9-15.4-61 0-70.7 57.3-128 128-128s128 57.3 128 128-57.3 128-128 128z"></path></svg> Discuss on the forum</a></p>]]></content>

Joplin 2.10 is here and we've made some amazing improvements and bug fixes, with a focus on the mobile app.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-design-for-new-note-and-new-to-do-buttons">New design for "New note" and "New to-do" buttons<a href="#new-design-for-new-note-and-new-to-do-buttons" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers New design for &quot;New note&quot; and &quot;New to-do&quot; buttons" title="Lien direct vers New design for &quot;New note&quot; and &quot;New to-do&quot; buttons">​</a></h2><p>We're excited to announce that we've made it even easier to create new notes and to-do lists with new designs for the "New note" and "New to-do" buttons.</p><p>If there is enough space, the button labels will be shown in full:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20230508-new-note-1.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>While for those who prefer a more narrow note list, only the button icons will be shown:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20230508-new-note-2.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>It's a small improvement, but we're confident it will make the app even more intuitive for new users.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fixes-and-improvements">Fixes and improvements<a href="#fixes-and-improvements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Fixes and improvements" title="Lien direct vers Fixes and improvements">​</a></h2><p>This version includes 30 bug fixes and 16 general improvements. Let's dive into some of the highlights:</p><ul><li>Self Not Found and Pedro have been working tirelessly on improving the pasting of plain text in the application, and we're happy to say that there is now a brand new "Paste as text" option in the Edit menu.</li><li>For our amazing plugin developers out there, we have added a few new APIs and fixed a bug that was preventing certain plugins from starting. You can now get even more creative with your plugins!</li><li>Tao Klerks, has been hard at work fixing and improving the custom sort order of the note list. No more notes in the wrong position when you drop them! Plus, custom sort order is now synchronised too.</li><li>We've also fixed a few bugs with our Web Clipper, including an issue where certain pages wouldn't import their images. A new Web Clipper has also been released, so you can clip to your heart's content!</li></ul><p>Last but not least, we have modernised both the desktop and mobile application modules, just <a href="https://joplinapp.org/news/20221115-renovate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as we previously announced</a>. Although these changes may not be visible to you, they required a lot of work! But the result is that our applications are now more stable and secure, and it will be easier to maintain them in the long run. We're using a tool called <a href="https://www.mend.io/free-developer-tools/renovate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Renovate</a>, which will automatically propose package updates that we will review. In total, we've updated a whopping 633 packages so far!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="android-app-is-available-in-the-play-store">Android app is available in the Play Store<a href="#android-app-is-available-in-the-play-store" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Android app is available in the Play Store" title="Lien direct vers Android app is available in the Play Store">​</a></h2><p>Our latest version, 2.10, is now back in the Play Store and ready for download! Although we had to skip 2.9 due to some of Google's requirements, we worked hard to ensure that our app complies with their standards, and we are excited to announce that we are back and better than ever! Our iOS version is also available, so you can continue to enjoy the app regardless of the platform you use.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="biometrics-support">Biometrics support<a href="#biometrics-support" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Biometrics support" title="Lien direct vers Biometrics support">​</a></h3><p>To make your experience even more secure, our Android and iOS apps now support biometric unlock! With just a quick scan of your fingerprint or Face ID, you can unlock your app in no time. To enable this beta feature, just head over to the settings and click on "Use biometrics to secure access to the app".</p><p>We've tested this feature thoroughly during prerelease, and have already fixed all known issues. However we still consider it as a beta feature for now, so if you run into any issues please let us know.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="support-for-multiple-profile">Support for multiple profile<a href="#support-for-multiple-profile" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Support for multiple profile" title="Lien direct vers Support for multiple profile">​</a></h3><p>We're thrilled to announce that multiple profiles are now supported in our mobile app!

We know how frustrating that can be, and we're thrilled to have solved this issue. Getting filesystem sync to work on Android is never easy due to the restrictions put in place by Google, especially since they frequently change, but we're committed to delivering the best possible experience for our Android users.</p><hr><p><a href="https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/30716" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fab" data-icon="discourse" class="svg-inline--fa fa-discourse fa-lg" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 448 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M225.9 32C103.3 32 0 130.5 0 252.1 0 256 .1 480 .1 480l225.8-.2c122.7 0 222.1-102.3 222.1-223.9C448 134.3 348.6 32 225.9 32zM224 384c-19.4 0-37.9-4.3-54.4-12.1L88.5 392l22.9-75c-9.8-18.1-15.4-38.9-15.4-61 0-70.7 57.3-128 128-128s128 57.3 128 128-57.3 128-128 128z"></path></svg> Discuss on the forum</a></p>]]></content>

Our aim is to make it effortlessly user-friendly, seamlessly integrated, and possibly enabled by default.</p><p>To achieve this objective, we have implemented several enhancements in this version. These improvements encompass more streamlined management of encryption keys and simplified setup processes for both new and existing devices utilising end-to-end encryption.</p><p>Moreover, we have upgraded the encryption algorithm from AES-128 to AES-256, ensuring heightened security for your data in the long run.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="export-a-mermaid-graph">Export a Mermaid graph<a href="#export-a-mermaid-graph" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Export a Mermaid graph" title="Lien direct vers Export a Mermaid graph">​</a></h3><p>There is now a context menu on Mermaid graphs which you can use to export your graph as PNG, SVG, or by copying the vector data to the clipboard.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20230711-mermaid-export.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="auto-detect-language-on-startup">Auto-detect language on startup<a href="#auto-detect-language-on-startup" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Auto-detect language on startup" title="Lien direct vers Auto-detect language on startup">​</a></h3><p>A small but useful change - the application language is now automatically detected startup.

Notably, we've introduced support for plugin toolbar icons. Additionally, we've refined the editor's ability to manage text that's copied from applications like Word, Office, and LibreOffice, thereby enhancing cross-application compatibility. Among the minor yet impactful improvements, we've fine-tuned the handling of newlines and paragraphs—a highly requested feature. Another notable update is the improved automatic switching between light and dark modes.</p><p>Altogether, this release encompasses around 12 significant changes for the Rich Text editor, and rest assured, there's more to come in the future!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="share-permissions">Share permissions<a href="#share-permissions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Share permissions" title="Lien direct vers Share permissions">​</a></h3><p>Using Joplin Cloud Pro and Teams, you now have the ability to customize the read and write permissions for the notebooks you share. You have the option to grant other users permission to edit the notes or share them as read-only. This ensures that you can confidently share a notebook without worrying about unintentional modifications by your friends or colleagues.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20230825-share-permissions.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="email-to-note">Email to Note<a href="#email-to-note" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Email to Note" title="Lien direct vers Email to Note">​</a></h3><p>Joplin Cloud Pro and Teams also now include the Email to Note feature, allowing you to conveniently store your emails within Joplin Cloud. By simply forwarding your emails to your Joplin Cloud address, you can transform them into notes. The email's subject will serve as the note title, while the body of the email will be the note's content. These notes will be organized within a notebook named "Inbox."</p><p>More information in the <a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/email_to_note" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Email to Note documentation</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="choose-to-resize-an-image-or-not">Choose to resize an image or not<a href="#choose-to-resize-an-image-or-not" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Choose to resize an image or not" title="Lien direct vers Choose to resize an image or not">​</a></h3><p>By default, when you add a large image, Joplin will ask you if you would like to shrink it down or not. With this new release, you now have the option to always ask, to always resize, or to never resize the image, giving you more flexibility and reducing the number of prompts in the app.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20230825-resize-note.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="rotating-log">Rotating log<a href="#rotating-log" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Rotating log" title="Lien direct vers Rotating log">​</a></h3><p>Up until now, the logs could grow to become very large, and if you wanted to shrink them down you would have to manually delete them. With this new release, we now automatically handle logs by rotating them - once the log becomes large enough it is moved to an archive. And once the archive is older than a number of days, it is deleted.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="mobile">Mobile<a href="#mobile" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Mobile" title="Lien direct vers Mobile">​</a></h3><p>Like the desktop app, the mobile apps benefits from the Share Permissions update, as well as the Email to Note feature for Joplin Cloud.

It looks good and it's even interactive! (You can click to collapse/expand blocks of text) But unfortunately it doesn't scale to large workflows, like we have for Joplin - the log can freeze and it will take forever to search for something. Indeed searching is done in "real time"... which mostly means it will freeze for a minute or two for each letter you type in the search box. Not great.</p><p>Thankfully GitHub provides an alternative access: the raw logs. This is much better because they will open as plain text, without any styling or JS magic, which means you can use the browser native search and it will be fast.</p><p>But now the problem is that raw logs look like this:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20230116-ga-raw-log.png" alt="Raw log without extension" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>While it's not impossible to read, all colours that would display nicely in a terminal are gone and replaced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ANSI codes</a>. You can find what you need in there but it's not particularly easy.</p><p>This is where the new <strong>GitHub Action Raw Log Viewer</strong> extension for Chrome can help. It will parse your raw log and convert the ANSI codes to proper colours. This results in a much more readable rendering:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20230116-ga-raw-log-colored.png" alt="Raw log with extension" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The extension is fast even for very large logs and it's of course easy to search for text since it simply works with your browser built-in search.</p><p>The extension is open source, with the code available here: <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/github-actions-logs-extension" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/laurent22/github-actions-logs-extension</a></p><p>And to install it, follow this link:</p><p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-action-raw-log-vie/lgejlnoopmcdglhfjblaeldbcfnmjddf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20230116-extension-get-it-now.png" alt="Download GitHub Action Raw Log Viewer extension" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><hr><p><a href="https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/29139" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fab" data-icon="discourse" class="svg-inline--fa fa-discourse fa-lg" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 448 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M225.9 32C103.3 32 0 130.5 0 252.1 0 256 .1 480 .1 480l225.8-.2c122.7 0 222.1-102.3 222.1-223.9C448 134.3 348.6 32 225.9 32zM224 384c-19.4 0-37.9-4.3-54.4-12.1L88.5 392l22.9-75c-9.8-18.1-15.4-38.9-15.4-61 0-70.7 57.3-128 128-128s128 57.3 128 128-57.3 128-128 128z"></path></svg> Discuss on the forum</a></p>]]></content>

You can distribute modified versions if you keep track of the changes and the date you made them. As per usual with GNU licenses, you must license derivatives under AGPL. It provides the same restrictions and freedoms as the GPLv3 but with an additional clause which makes it so that source code must be distributed along with web publication. Since web sites and services are never distributed in the traditional sense, the AGPL is the GPL of the web.

The only difference is that we'll ask to sign an Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA) to ensure that the copyright of the entire codebase remains with the Joplin organisation. This is necessary so that if we ever want to change the license again we are able to do so without having to get the agreement of each individual contributor afterwards (which would be nearly impossible).</p><p>This is a bit of an extra constraint but it is hard to avoid. Contributor License Agreements are very common for GPL or AGPL projects.

In the next version, the viewer will also include a way to annotate PDF files.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="multi-language-spell-checking">Multi-language spell checking<a href="#multi-language-spell-checking" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Multi-language spell checking" title="Lien direct vers Multi-language spell checking">​</a></h2><p>The desktop app include a multi-language spell checking features, which allows you, for example, to spell-check notes in your native language and in English.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-mobile-text-editor">New mobile text editor<a href="#new-mobile-text-editor" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers New mobile text editor" title="Lien direct vers New mobile text editor">​</a></h2><p>Writing formatted notes on mobile has always been cumbersome due to the need to enter special format characters like <code>*</code> or <code>[</code>, etc.</p><p>Thanks to the work of Henry Heino during GSoC, writing notes on the go is now easier thanks to an improved Markdown editor.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20221216-mobile-beta-editor.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The most visible feature is the addition of a toolbar, which helps input those special characters, like on desktop.</p><p>Moreover Henry made a lot of subtle but useful improvements to the editor, for example to improve the note appearance, to improve list continuation, etc. Search within a note is now also supported as well as spell-checking.</p><p>At a more technical level, Henry also added many test units to ensure that the editor remains robust and reliable.</p><p>To enable the feature, go to the configuration screen and selected "Opt-in to the editor beta". It is already very stable so we will probably promote it to be the main editor from the next version.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="improved-alignment-of-notebook-icons">Improved alignment of notebook icons<a href="#improved-alignment-of-notebook-icons" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Improved alignment of notebook icons" title="Lien direct vers Improved alignment of notebook icons">​</a></h2><p>Previously, when you would assign an icon to a notebook, it would shift the title to the right, but notebook without an icon would not. It means that notebooks with and without an icon would not be vertically aligned.</p><p>To tidy things up, this new version adds a default icons to notebooks without an explicitly assigned icon. This result in the notebook titles being correctly vertically aligned.</p><p>Note that this feature is only enabled if you use custom icons - otherwise it will simply display the notebook titles without any default icons, as before.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20221216-notebook-icons.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="improved-handling-of-file-attachments">Improved handling of file attachments<a href="#improved-handling-of-file-attachments" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Improved handling of file attachments" title="Lien direct vers Improved handling of file attachments">​</a></h2><p>Self Not Found made a number of small but useful improvements to attachment handling, including increasing the maximum size to 200MB, adding support for attaching multiple files, and fixing issues with synchronising attachments via proxy.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fixed-filesystem-sync-on-mobile">Fixed filesystem sync on mobile<a href="#fixed-filesystem-sync-on-mobile" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Fixed filesystem sync on mobile" title="Lien direct vers Fixed filesystem sync on mobile">​</a></h2><p>This was a long and complex change due to the need to support new Android APIs but hopefully that should now be working again, thanks to the work of jd1378.</p><p>So you can now sync again your notes with Syncthing and other file-based synchronisation systems.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="and-more">And more...<a href="#and-more" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers And more..." title="Lien direct vers And more...">​</a></h2><p>In total this new desktop version includes 36 improvements, bug fixes, and security fixes.</p><p>As always, a lot of work went into the Android and iOS app too, which include 37 improvements, bug fixes, and security fixes.</p><p>See here for the changelogs:</p><ul><li><a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/about/changelog/desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Desktop app changelog</a></li><li><a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/about/changelog/android/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android app changelog</a></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-the-android-version">About the Android version<a href="#about-the-android-version" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers About the Android version" title="Lien direct vers About the Android version">​</a></h2><p>Unfortunately we cannot publish the Android version because it is based on a framework version that Google does not accept. To upgrade the app a lot of changes are needed and another round of pre-releases, and therefore there will not be a 2.9 version for Google Play. You may however download the official APK directly from there: <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin-android/releases/tag/android-v2.9.8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android 2.9 Official Release</a></p><p>This is the reality of app stores in general - small developers being imposed never ending new requirements by all-powerful companies, and by the time a version is finally ready we can't even publish it because yet more requirements are in place.</p><p>For the record the current 2.9 app works perfectly fine. It targets Android 11, which is only 2 years old and is still supported (and installed on millions of phones). Google requires us to target Android 12 which only came out last year.</p><hr><p><a href="https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/28661" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fab" data-icon="discourse" class="svg-inline--fa fa-discourse fa-lg" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 448 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M225.9 32C103.3 32 0 130.5 0 252.1 0 256 .1 480 .1 480l225.8-.2c122.7 0 222.1-102.3 222.1-223.9C448 134.3 348.6 32 225.9 32zM224 384c-19.4 0-37.9-4.3-54.4-12.1L88.5 392l22.9-75c-9.8-18.1-15.4-38.9-15.4-61 0-70.7 57.3-128 128-128s128 57.3 128 128-57.3 128-128 128z"></path></svg> Discuss on the forum</a></p>]]></content>

This <a href="https://www.mend.io/free-developer-tools/renovate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Renovate tool</a> is a way to manage dependencies - it automatically finds what needs to be updated, then upgrade it to the latest version, and create a pull request. If all tests pass, we can then merge this pull request. So far we have merged 267 of these pull requests.</p><p>Updating Joplin packages was long due. It is necessary so that we don't fall behind and end up using unsupported or deprecated packages. We also benefit from bug fixes and performance improvements. It is also important in terms of security, since recent package versions usually include various security fixes.</p><p>We used to rely on a tool called "npm audit" to do this, however it no longer works on the Joplin codebase, and it was always risky to use it since it would update multiple packages in one command - so if something went wrong it was difficult to find the culprit.</p><p>Renovate on the other hand upgrades packages one at a time, and run our test units to ensure everything is still working as expected. It also upgrades multiple instances of the same package across the monorepo, which is convenient to keep our code consistent. It also has a number of options to make our life easier, such as the ability to automatically merge a pull request for patch releases since this is usually safe (when a package is, for example upgraded from 1.0.1 to 1.0.3).</p><p>Although Renovate automates the package upgrades it doesn't mean all upgrades are straightforward - our tests won't catch all issues, so the apps might end up being broken or cannot be compiled anymore. So there's manual work involved to get everything working after certain upgrades - for the most part this has been done and the apps appear to be stable so far.</p><p>This will however be an important part of pre-release 2.10 (or should it be 3.0?) - we hope that everything works but we may need your support to try this version and report any glitch you may have found. As always pre-release regressions have the highest priority so we aim to fix them as quickly as possible.</p><hr><p><a href="https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/28366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fab" data-icon="discourse" class="svg-inline--fa fa-discourse fa-lg" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 448 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M225.9 32C103.3 32 0 130.5 0 252.1 0 256 .1 480 .1 480l225.8-.2c122.7 0 222.1-102.3 222.1-223.9C448 134.3 348.6 32 225.9 32zM224 384c-19.4 0-37.9-4.3-54.4-12.1L88.5 392l22.9-75c-9.8-18.1-15.4-38.9-15.4-61 0-70.7 57.3-128 128-128s128 57.3 128 128-57.3 128-128 128z"></path></svg> Discuss on the forum</a></p>]]></content>

This was mostly for convenience since it meant I could get things going quickly without having to setup a special structure for it.</p><p>Now that Joplin Cloud is becoming more mature however a proper company, simply called Joplin, has been created. This company will be based in France, and will be used mainly to handle the commercial part of the project, which currently is mostly Joplin Cloud. I'm still heading the company so there won't be any major change to the way the project is managed.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-does-it-mean-for-joplin-cloud">What does it mean for Joplin Cloud?<a href="#what-does-it-mean-for-joplin-cloud" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers What does it mean for Joplin Cloud?" title="Lien direct vers What does it mean for Joplin Cloud?">​</a></h2><p>There will be no significant change - the website ownership simply moves from one company in the UK to one in France.

You can now create as many application profile as you wish, each with their own settings, and easily switch from one to another. The main use case is to support for example a "work" profile and a "personal" profile, to allow you to keep things independent, and each profile can sync with a different sync target.</p><p>To create a new profile, open <strong>File <!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> Switch profile</strong> and select <strong>Create new profile</strong>, enter the profile name and press OK. The app will automatically switch to this new profile, which you can now configure.</p><p>To switch back to the previous profile, again open <strong>File <!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> Switch profile</strong> and select <strong>Default</strong>.</p><p>Note that profiles all share certain settings, such as language, font size, theme, etc. This is done so that you don't have reconfigure every details when switching profiles. Other settings such as sync configuration is per profile.</p><p>The feature is available on desktop only for now, and should be ported to mobile relatively soon.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="save-mermaid-graph-as-pngsvg">Save Mermaid graph as PNG/SVG<a href="#save-mermaid-graph-as-pngsvg" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Save Mermaid graph as PNG/SVG" title="Lien direct vers Save Mermaid graph as PNG/SVG">​</a></h2><p>This convenient feature allows exporting a Mermaid graph as a PNG or SVG image, or allows copying the image as a DataUrl, which can then be pasted in any compatible text editor.

We look forward to start working with the contributors on some great new projects. This year's main themes are:</p><ul><li><strong>Mobile and tablet development</strong> - we want to improve the mobile/tablet application on iOS and Android.</li><li><strong>Plugin and external apps</strong> - leverage the Joplin API to create plugins and external apps.</li><li>And of course contributors are welcome to suggest their own ideas.</li></ul><p>Our full idea list is available here: <a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/dev/gsoc/gsoc2022/ideas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GSoC 2022 idea list</a></p><p>In the coming month (<strong>March 7 - April 3</strong>), contributors will start getting involved in the forum and start discussing project ideas with the mentors and community. It's also a good time to start looking at Joplin's source code, perhaps work on fixing bugs or implement small features to get familiar with the source code, and to show us your skills.</p><p>One difference with previous years is that anyone, not just students, are allowed to participate.</p><p>Additionally, last year Google only allowed smaller projects, while this year they allow again small and large projects, so we've indicated this in the idea list - the small ones are <strong>175 hours</strong>, and the large ones <strong>350 hours</strong>.</p>]]></content>

There's about 26 improvements and 25 bugs and security fixes included - as always many of these apply to both the mobile and desktop app (see the <a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/about/changelog/desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">desktop changelog</a> and <a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/about/changelog/android/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mobile changelog</a>).</p><p>Many thanks to all the contributors who helped create this release!</p><p>Below are some of the more noticeable changes:</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="notebook-custom-icons">Notebook custom icons<a href="#notebook-custom-icons" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Notebook custom icons" title="Lien direct vers Notebook custom icons">​</a></h2><p>Since version 2.6 it was possible to assign an emoji icon to a notebook, and with this new version it's now possible to assign any custom icon. The icon may be a PNG or JPG file of any size. The app will then import the file and resize it to the correct size. To use a custom icon, follow these steps:</p><p>Right-click on a notebook, and select "Edit":</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20220224-edit-notebook.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In the "Edit notebook" dialog, click "Select file..." and browse to your icon image:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20220224-edit-dialog.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Click "OK" and the icon will now appear next to the notebook:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20220224-notebook-icon.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The icon can be changed only from the desktop application at the moment, but it will sync and be displayed correctly on the mobile app too.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="plugin-api-improvements">Plugin API improvements<a href="#plugin-api-improvements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Plugin API improvements" title="Lien direct vers Plugin API improvements">​</a></h2><p>This version also includes a number of improvements to the plugin API, in particular it is now easier to customise the editor context menu from a plugin and dynamically add items to it depending on the context. For example, with the Rich Markdown plugin it will be possible to right-click on an image and open it, or copy it to the clipboard.</p><p>A few additional functions have also been added to make plugin development simpler - in particular a command to open any item, whether it's a notebook, note, tag or attachement; and functions to work with attachements, in particular to reveal an attachement in the system file explorer, and to track changes to an attachement.</p>]]></content>

The most visible one is the addition of a sort button above the note list - it allows sorting by modification date, creation date, title or by custom order, in either ascending or descending order:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20211217-120324_0.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>By default, this sort order is going to apply to all notebooks, however you can now also assign a per-notebook sort order. In this case, any sort order will be apply to that notebook only. To enable this behaviour, simply right-click on a notebook and select "Toggle own sort order":</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20211217-120324_1.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Thanks to Kenichi Kobayashi for developing this feature!</p><p><strong>Support for notebook icons</strong></p><p>It is now possible to associate icons with notebooks no both the desktop and mobile applications. To do so, right-click on a notebook and selected "Edit".</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20211217-120324_2.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This will open the new notebook dialog from which can change the title and assign an icon. For now the icons are emojis but perhaps custom icons could be supported later on.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20211217-120324_3.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>Allow collaborating on encrypted notebooks using Joplin Cloud</strong></p><p>Thanks to the encryption improvements in the previous Joplin versions it is now possible to share and collaborated on encrypted notebooks, when synchronising with Joplin Cloud (or Joplin Server).</p><p>To get this working, you and the recipient will need to have Joplin 2.6 and the person who shares will need to have encryption enabled. After that most of the process is handled automatically by the apps - in particular it will automatically generate and share the required encryption keys for each users.</p><p><strong>Improved synchronisation startup speed</strong></p><p>Synchronisation is also a bit faster in this release due to an optimisation on the startup process. When syncing, the app needs to acquire a lock, which may be time consuming since it requires making multiple requests. This has now been optimised so that less requests are necessary and also each request consumes less resources. This will have a postive impact on Joplin Cloud in particular, but you should also see improvements with Joplin Server and smaller improvements with the other sync targets.</p><p><strong>Improved Markdown editor split view scrolling</strong></p><p>Kenichi Kobayashi made some great improvements to the Markdown editor scrolling in this release. The issue before was that the editor on the left and the viewer on the right would often not be in sync, in particular if the note contains several images and other media.</p><p>With Kenichi's change the editor and viewer stay nicely in sync, regardless of the note content. In fact it looks a bit like magic when you scroll through large notes - notice in particular how each side appear to wait for the other or speed up in order to make sure both sides are aligned as well possible. Kenichi provides a nice technical documentation about the feature <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/5512#issuecomment-931277022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wbs5XZR0oeU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wbs5XZR0oeU</a></p><p><strong>Improved and optimised S3 synchronisation</strong></p><p>Thanks to the efforts of Lee Matos, synchronisation with S3 is now more reliable and errors are also better handled. The underlying S3 SDK has also been upgraded from v2 to v3 which results in a smaller executable size (about 3-5 MB depending on the operating system)</p><p><strong>Export notes as self-contained HTML files</strong></p><p>Exporting a single note as HTML is now more user friendly as all images, scripts, styles and other attachments are all packed into a single HTML file (Previously it would create multiples files and directories). This makes it easier to share the complete note with someone who doesn't have Joplin.</p><p><strong>Other changes and bug fixes</strong></p><p>This release includes a total of 19 new features and improvements and 16 bug fixes. See the 2.6.x changelogs for more details:</p><p><a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/about/changelog/desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://joplinapp.org/help/about/changelog/desktop</a></p><p><a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/about/changelog/android/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://joplinapp.org/help/about/changelog/android/</a></p><p><a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/about/changelog/ios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://joplinapp.org/help/about/changelog/ios/</a></p><p><a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/about/changelog/cli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://joplinapp.org/help/about/changelog/cli/</a></p>]]></content>

Normally that shouldn't take too long but you might want to make sure you won't need the server right away when you process this.</p><p>The second database migration will add a unique constraint on <a href="http://items.name" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">items.name</a> and items.owner_id and that's where the breaking change might be. Normally this data is already unique because that's enforced by the application but in some rare cases, due a race condition, there could be duplicate data in there. If that happens the migration will fail and the server will not start.</p><p>If that happens, you'll need to decide what to do with the data, as it's not possible to automatically decide. You can find all duplicates using this query:</p><code>**select** count(*), name, owner_id**from** items **group** **by** name, owner_id**having** count(*) &gt; 1;</code><p>Once you have the list of IDs you have a few options:</p><ul><li>Find the corresponding item in Joplin (it can unfortunately be anything - a note, resource, folder, etc.), then delete it and sync.</li><li>Or, just delete the data directly in the database. You'll want to delete the corresponding item_id from the user_items table too.</li></ul><p>But really in most cases you should be fine. Especially if you don't have that many notes it's unlikely you have duplicates.</p>]]></content>

Here's an overview of the changes:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="support-for-markdown--front-matter">Support for Markdown + Front Matter<a href="#support-for-markdown--front-matter" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Support for Markdown + Front Matter" title="Lien direct vers Support for Markdown + Front Matter">​</a></h3><p>Markdown + Front Matter is a format that allows attaching metadata, such as tags, creation date, or geolocation to a Markdown file. This is done by adding a block of YAML code (a "front matter") at the top of the file.</p><p>Thansk to Caleb John's efforts the Joplin desktop and CLI applications now support importing and exporting these files. When exporting, we try to preserve as much metadata as possible, while still keeping it the formatting user friendly.</p><p>Here's an example, with the Front Matter at the top, delimited by "---", and the text below.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20211031-115215_0.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Markdown + Front Matter is an excellent way to share notes with someone who doesn't have Joplin, to backup notes in a durable format (since no third-party application is needed to read it), and also to export notes to other applications, or to import them.</p><p>As with the regular Markdown exporter, the images and attachments are also exported.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="add-support-for-callback-urls">Add support for callback URLs<a href="#add-support-for-callback-urls" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Add support for callback URLs" title="Lien direct vers Add support for callback URLs">​</a></h3><p>Callback URLs is a semi-standard that defines how certain resources in an application can be accessed via URLs. Either to view the resource, or to perform certain actions, such as deletion, creation, etc.</p><p>Joplin now support callback URLs to open notes, notebooks and folders. To do so, right click on a note and select "Copy external link":</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20211031-115215_1.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>That would give you a URL such as this:</p><blockquote><p>joplin://x-callback-url/openNote?id=b7a7b93281f54d928612eea550f33a7f</p></blockquote><p>Then if you click it from outside the app, the app will open and select this particular note. In practice such a feature allows third-party application to interact with Joplin by creating links that can be opened from outside. For example, you may use a different application for project planning, then link to the individual notes for more details about each task.</p><p>Many thanks to Roman Musin for adding the feature!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="improved-end-to-end-encryption-support">Improved end-to-end encryption support<a href="#improved-end-to-end-encryption-support" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Improved end-to-end encryption support" title="Lien direct vers Improved end-to-end encryption support">​</a></h3><p>The series of quiet but major changes to the end-to-end encryption support continue in this new verison. One goal is still to allow sharing notebooks while encryption is enabled.</p><p>To that end, v2.5 includes support for RSA public-private key pairs. If you have encryption enabled, they will be automatically generated when you synchronise by the mobile, desktop or CLI applications. Later on, these keys will be used to allow sharing encrypted notebooks.</p><p>The second goal of these E2EE changes is to simplify the system enough that it can be enabled by default. To that end, the master password dialog and encryption screen have been improved. An option to reset the master password is now also available.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="various-other-improvements-and-bug-fixes">Various other improvements and bug fixes<a href="#various-other-improvements-and-bug-fixes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Various other improvements and bug fixes" title="Lien direct vers Various other improvements and bug fixes">​</a></h3><p>In total this release includes about 11 other bug fixes and improvements. There was in particular several improvements to the share features. It is now also possible for a share recipient to leave the shared notebook.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="mobile-app-update">Mobile app update<a href="#mobile-app-update" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Mobile app update" title="Lien direct vers Mobile app update">​</a></h3><p>As always the mobile apps (to be released soon) benefit from several of the above changes since they share the same codebase as the desktop app.</p><p>Specific to the mobile version 2.5 are some improvements to the beta editor - in particular the layout has been cleaned up, and the first word of sentences is now automatically capitalised, which makes typing notes easier. If you haven't tried the beta editor yet, you can enable it from the Configuration screen.</p><p>The full changelog is available there: <a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/about/changelog/desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://joplinapp.org/help/about/changelog/desktop</a></p>]]></content>

Here's what's new in this release:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sync-wizard-dialog">Sync Wizard Dialog<a href="#sync-wizard-dialog" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Sync Wizard Dialog" title="Lien direct vers Sync Wizard Dialog">​</a></h3><p>A new Sync Wizard Dialog has been added to simplify setting up sync on new clients.</p><p>The dialog shows the main sync targets, their differences, and makes it easy to choose one and start synchronising. This is mostly aimed at new users or those perhaps less technical. Those who are self hosting or using complex setups will still easily find what they need from a link on that dialog (or in Config <!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> Synchronisation like before).</p><p>Sync setup on mobile has been slightly improved too - now on a new client, instead of asking you to sync with Dropbox directly (which may not be what you want), it jumps to the Config <!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> Synchronisation section where you can select the sync target</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20210929-144036_0.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="disable-synchronisation">Disable synchronisation<a href="#disable-synchronisation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Disable synchronisation" title="Lien direct vers Disable synchronisation">​</a></h3><p>It's a small change but something that's been asked many time - it's now possible to disable synchronisation entirely by selecting "None" as a sync target. Previously that could be done in a hacky way, by selecting a non-configured sync target. Now it's clearer and easier to do.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20210929-144036_1.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="add-back-support-for-deprecated-plugins">Add back support for deprecated plugins<a href="#add-back-support-for-deprecated-plugins" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Add back support for deprecated plugins" title="Lien direct vers Add back support for deprecated plugins">​</a></h3><p>Recently some plugins stopped working because deprecated plugin APIs had been removed. It had been planned for a long time but I suspect the warnings weren't visible enough so plugin developers didn't act on them, and as a result many plugins stopped working.</p><p>This is now fixed in the latest version. A selected number of plugins will have access to these old deprecated APIs, which means they will start working again. This was mainly affecting ambrt's plugins such as "Convert Text To New Note" or the popular "Embed Search" plugin.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="add-support-for-recommended-plugins">Add support for recommended plugins<a href="#add-support-for-recommended-plugins" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Add support for recommended plugins" title="Lien direct vers Add support for recommended plugins">​</a></h3><p>As mentioned in an earlier post, we now support <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/introducing-in-55618802" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recommended plugins</a>. These recommended plugins appear on top when searching and are identified by a small crown.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20210929-144036_2.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="end-to-end-encryption-improvements">End to End Encryption improvements<a href="#end-to-end-encryption-improvements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers End to End Encryption improvements" title="Lien direct vers End to End Encryption improvements">​</a></h3><p>Like most recent releases, v2.4 includes a few improvement to the End to End Encryption (E2EE) system. The goal is to make it easier to use, to make it more reliable and to support the future use case of sharing encrypted notebooks or notes.</p><p>One important change is the support for a master password. This single password will be responsible to encrypt various keys, including some that will be automatically generated. Thanks to this, it won't be necessary to ask to enter a new password every time a key needs to be encrypted, since the master password can be used. It will also be easier to manage since you'll only have one password to remember instead of a different one for each notebook you might have shared.</p><p>Finally, it's now possible to disable a master key. What it means is that it will no longer show up in the list of master keys, and will also no longer generate a warning asking you to enter the password. In some case you might have forgotten it and no longer need it key, so you can now disable it.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="custom-css">Custom CSS<a href="#custom-css" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Custom CSS" title="Lien direct vers Custom CSS">​</a></h3><p>This version also introduces a few internal change to better support custom CSS. In particular the colours now come from a CSS file, which could potentially be overridden, and new UI elements are styled using stylesheets, which likewise could be overridden.</p><p>Those are just first steps, but eventually these changes will make it easier to style the UI and create new themes.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bug-fixes">Bug fixes<a href="#bug-fixes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Bug fixes" title="Lien direct vers Bug fixes">​</a></h3><p>This release also includes about 30 various bug fixes and improvements.</p><p>A notable one is a fix for GotoAnything, which recently wasn't working on first try.</p><p>The plugin screen has also been improved so that search works even when GitHub is down or blocked, as it is in China in particular.</p>]]></content>

In fact probably all of them are safe but as a new user that's not necessarily easy to know. So to help with this, the next version of Joplin will support recommended plugins - those will be plugins that meet our standards of quality and performance, and they will be indicated by a small crown tag inside the plugin box. Recommended plugins will also appear on top when searching.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20210901-113415_0.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>For now, since we don't have a review process, the recommended plugins are those developed by the Joplin team and frequent contributors, because we know those are safe to use.</p><p>Later we might have a review process and add more recommended plugins. That being said, in the meantime even if a plugin is not marked as recommended, there's a good chance it is still safe and have good performance too. Often you can search for it on the forum and if it's active with many users commenting, you're most likely good to go.</p><p>But if there's any doubt, the recommended tag is a good way to be sure.</p>]]></content>

There is no known bugs and the service is running smoothly so it's now safe to say that it is production ready!</p><p>As a reminder, Joplin Cloud is meant to provide a more seamless Joplin experience - if you want to quickly get started, it's as easy as downloading the app and getting a Joplin Cloud account. Besides improved sync performance, that will give you the ability to collaborate on notebooks with others, as well as publishing and sharing notes.</p><p>Of course Joplin still supports other sync options such as Nextcloud, Dropbox and OneDrive or AWS S3. You can also self host using Joplin Server. The advantage of Joplin Cloud being that you don't need to maintain a server yourself - for a small fee you'll get that taken care of.</p><p>Additionally, subscribing to Joplin Cloud is a great way to support the project as a whole, including the open source applications. Such support is needed in the long term to provide bug and security fixes, add new features, and provide support.</p><p>At some level it is also an experiment, to see if such a service is financially viable and can allow me to work full time on the project. This is certainly something I would like, and perhaps Joplin Cloud combined with your donations will allow that.</p>]]></content>

It had a lot of useful content but finding your way was tricky and, for new users, it wasn't clear what Joplin was about. Finding out how to install the app wasn't obvious since the download buttons were lost in the clutter of information.</p><p>So the new website includes a front page with clear goals:</p><ul><li>Allows people to easily download the app - for that there's a large Download button at the top and bottom of the page. It redirects to a page that automatically picks the version based on your operating system.</li><li>Showcase the application key features. The <a href="https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/what-are-the-key-features-of-joplin/5837" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">key features post</a> on the forum helped narrow down what Joplin is about, so there are sections about the web clipper, the open source nature of the app, encryption, synchronisation, customisation and the ability to create multimedia notes.</li><li>The top screenshots have also been updated (the previous one was showing a dev version from 2016, before the app was even released). As a nod to Scott Joplin, the screenshot shows an imaginary plan to open a vintage piano store, with various tasks, tables, documents and images attached, to showcase Joplin features.</li><li>Finally there's a Press section, which includes extracts from some cool articles that have been written about the app.</li></ul><p>Also many thanks to everyone who voted and contributed to the tagline discussion! It helped narrow down what the tagline should be, along with the equally important description below. If you have any question or notice any issue with the website let me know!</p>]]></content>

It's been present since version 2.x and the feature is getting close to be stable.</p><p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p><p>When connected to Joplin Server (or the upcoming Joplin Cloud service), a new "Share notebook" menu item is available when right-clicking on a notebook.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20210621-104753_0.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Click on it, and it will display a new dialog where you can add any number of recipients. Those recipients also need to be on the same Joplin Server instance. From this dialog you can also remove a recipient or unshare the whole notebook, in which case it will be removed from everybody's note collection, except yours.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20210621-104753_1.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Once this is done, the recipient(s) will receive a notification in Joplin the next time they synchronise their data:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20210621-104753_2.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Then, finally, once the invitation is accepted, Joplin will download all the shared notebooks and notes. A shared notebook is denoted by the usual Share icon. Now the invited user can read or modify the shared notes, add attachments, etc. and the changes will be visible to everyone with access to the notebook.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20210621-104753_3.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>What's the availability of the notebook sharing feature?</strong></p><p>The notebook sharing feature is available on Joplin Server and Joplin Cloud.</p><p>On desktop, you can share notebooks and of course view or modify any notebook that has been shared with you.</p><p>On mobile and CLI, you cannot currently share notebooks, but you can view or modify any notebook that has been shared with you.</p><p><strong>If I share a notebook with someone, what access do they have?</strong></p><p>Currently they have full access to the data, including reading, writing and deleting notebooks or notes. In a future version, access control might be implemented. For example, to only give read-only access to the shared notebook.</p><p><strong>What can actually be shared?</strong></p><p>All the sub-notebooks, notes and resources within the shared notebook are shared.</p><p><strong>Does it work with End-To-End-Encryption?</strong></p><p>Yes and no. It is possible to use the share notebook feature even with E2EE enabled, however any shared notebook or note will not be encrypted, otherwise you would have had to give your master key password to the people you share with, which you'd probably not want to do.</p><p>In a future version, this might be supported. For example by automatically creating a new master key for the shared notebook. You would then provide the recipients with that master key password.</p><p><strong>What can it be used for?</strong></p><p>Some ideas:</p><ul><li>Plan a trip with friends or within a small organisation. For example, the notes could contain the maps, hotel and flight reservations, etc. or any document or note relevant to the trip. And all participants would have access to them.</li><li>Work on a project with colleagues. Everybody can access various work-related documents, add to them, modify them, etc. That could serve as a knowledge base for a project.</li><li>Another possible use, which has been requested many times, is to support multiple profiles. You could create a main profile that have access to all notes, and in there create a Work and Personal notebook. Then you would create a separate account for work. You can then share your Work notebook with that other account. That way the work account will only have access to the Work notebooks. You can use this technique in various ways to split your notebooks between multiple accounts and ensure strict separation between datasets.</li></ul>]]></content>

Critical parts of the app are now in TypeScript, including the synchronizer, database and encryption service. Joplin Server is also entirely in TypeScript. Even the database rows are now typed thanks to sql-ts.</p><p>So anyway TypeScript has been a big win for the project as it made it possible to refactor and modernise many parts of it in a safe way, and make the code future proof and easier to work with! I expect we should get to over 50% over the next few months.</p>]]></content>

There won't be a lot to do - pretty much just hand over fliers and answer the occasional question, which as Joplin users I'm sure you'll know the answer to.

Long term, the goal is to add collaboration features:</p><ul><li>Sharing a note with anyone, using a URL. When the note is changed, the content at the URL is changed too.</li><li>Sharing a notebook with a user on the same Joplin Server instance. For example, if you share a notebook with another user, that user will see this notebook in their desktop or mobile app, and will be able to edit the notes, etc.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="any-improvement-over-nextcloud">Any improvement over Nextcloud?<a href="#any-improvement-over-nextcloud" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Any improvement over Nextcloud?" title="Lien direct vers Any improvement over Nextcloud?">​</a></h3><p>For now, one benefit of using Joplin Server, compared to Nextcloud or WebDAV in general, is that it is much faster and resource efficient. I've done a basic test with Nextcloud and Joplin Server running on the same server. Both have mostly default settings (except Nextcloud which uses Redis for file locks):</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20210105-153008_0.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Why is it so much faster? I assume it's in part because the WebDAV protocol is terribly inefficient. It sends unnecessarily large XML blobs for every request, which are time consuming to download and parse. It also doesn't support delta sync (unlike Joplin Server), which means the complete file list needs to be downloaded before syncing in order to compare the local and remote items.</p><p>Finally it's possible that Nextcloud file locking system means an overhead on each request. It shouldn't be much since it's handled by Redis but who knows. Joplin Server doesn't need locking as data consistency is handled by the clients.</p><p>So just by following common sense and transferring only the required data in a sane format (JSON), we can have something more performant. In my case, I appreciate that the mobile app no longer freezes when it starts synchronising - before it would do that due to the large XML WebDAV file that needs to be parsed.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stability">Stability<a href="#stability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Stability" title="Lien direct vers Stability">​</a></h3><p>I've been using it with the desktop and mobile app for a few weeks now and haven't had any issue so far. The server also passes all the existing sync-related test units (sync, e2ee and lock handling) so I'm reasonably confident it can already be used. As always though, keep making backups in case there's any issue.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="suggestions-are-welcome">Suggestions are welcome<a href="#suggestions-are-welcome" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Suggestions are welcome" title="Lien direct vers Suggestions are welcome">​</a></h3><p>This is still a pre-release and if you notice anything off please let me know. In particular, I believe it doesn't gzip responses, so that will need to be added. The process also doesn't restart when it crashes, which could be solved with pm2.</p><p>Also if you have any idea on how to make installation easier, your feedback is welcome.</p>]]></content>

The <a href="/fr/help/api">plugin API</a> in particular has been significantly expanded, based on the developer feedback, so that more types of plugin are possible now, and indeed a few plugin concepts have started appearing on the forums. In particular all this could be done now:</p><ul><li>Access notes, folders, etc. via the data API</li><li>Add a view to display custom data using HTML/CSS/JS</li><li>Create a dialog to display information and get input from the user</li><li>Create a new command and associate a toolbar button or menu item with it</li><li>Get access to the note currently being edited and modify it</li><li>Listen to various events and run code when they happen</li><li>Hook into the application to set additional options and customise Joplin's behaviour</li><li>Create a module to export or import data into Joplin</li><li>Define new settings and setting sections, and get/set them from the plugin</li><li>Create a new Markdown plugin to render custom markup.</li><li>Create an editor plugin to modify low-level the behaviour of the Markdown editor (CodeMirror)</li></ul><p><strong>Plugin JPL format and configuration screen</strong></p><p>The plugin configuration screen has also been updated so that it's possible to import the new JPL (<strong>J</strong>oplin <strong>PL</strong>ugin) format and to enable/disable as well as uninstall plugins.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20201130-145937_0.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>What's next?</strong></p><p>It is now possible to create new plugins, package them into the JPL format, and to install them into the app.</p><p>The last piece missing is a way to discover and share plugins, and a way to update them easily, basically what we need is an online package manager. It is not clear yet how this is going to be done, but one idea would be to have a GitHub repository where anyone could submit or update a plugin, then the app would connect to that repository to make it easy to install new plugins. This is just an idea at this point though, and if you have any suggestion on other ways it could be done, feel free to let me know.

This was always tricky to add due to the custom editors (Rich Text and Markdown) we use, but thanks to the recent improvements in the Electron framework and to Caleb John's work on the Markdown editor it is now possible.</p><p>It should be working fine in both editors however it is currently considered Beta for the Markdown Editor because to enable the feature we had to use a special mode which in the past caused various issues. Now it seems to work well, at least we haven't noticed any bug so far, but please keep that in mind. If you notice any issue let us know in the forum.</p><p><strong>Enabling the spell checker</strong></p><p>To enable or disable the spell checker, simply click on the top right hand globe icon (or select Spell Checker in the Tools menu), then select the language you would like to use. Since the list of languages can be huge on certain operating system, the latest selected languages also appear just below the "Use spell checker" checkbox.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20201126-114649_0.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>Activating the Markdown Editor Beta spell checker</strong></p><p>By default, the spell checker is not activated in the Markdown editor even if "Use spell checker" is ticked because it is currently in Beta state.

As mentioned above, we think the feature is stable and haven't found any bug with it, however if you notice anything please let us know.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20201126-114649_1.png" class="img_ev3q"></p>]]></content>

Anjula developed over the past few months a system to allow configuring the keymap shortcuts, and created a nice editor for it. &nbsp;Here is what he has to say:</p><hr><p>Joplin desktop application supports keyboard shortcuts to a certain &nbsp;degree. However, there wasn't an option for users to configure keyboard &nbsp;shortcuts according to their preferences. My project was to implement a &nbsp;keyboard shortcut editor along with the necessary integration.</p><p>Custom keyboard shortcuts would be a great addition for all Joplin &nbsp;users including power users and those who are migrating to Joplin from &nbsp;other note-taking applications. People also do not have the same &nbsp;keyboard layout; not everyone has F6 necessarily. It would solve &nbsp;conflicts between different preferences of workflows, and increase &nbsp;discoverability for all keyboard shortcuts.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20200915-091108_0.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="back-end-service-for-handling-keymapping-related-functionality">Back-end service for handling keymapping-related functionality<a href="#back-end-service-for-handling-keymapping-related-functionality" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Back-end service for handling keymapping-related functionality" title="Lien direct vers Back-end service for handling keymapping-related functionality">​</a></h3><p>KeymapService builds an in-memory keymap based on the default keymap &nbsp;configuration. The default keymap configuration may vary from platform &nbsp;to platform. Essentially, the in-memory keymap binds a keyboard shortcut &nbsp;for some command of Joplin. Clients of KeymapService may obtain the &nbsp;keyboard shortcuts for some commands, and/or alter the keymap via the &nbsp;provided methods.</p><p>KeymapService also allows altering the keymap via a keymap file, &nbsp;which is located in the profile directory. Contents of this keymap file &nbsp;will take higher priority than the default keymap configuration, and &nbsp;will replace the default keyboard shortcuts.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the keymap always stays pristine with proper validation.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="keyboard-shortcut-editor-with-the-necessary-functionality-to-alter-the-keymap">Keyboard shortcut editor with the necessary functionality to alter the keymap<a href="#keyboard-shortcut-editor-with-the-necessary-functionality-to-alter-the-keymap" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Keyboard shortcut editor with the necessary functionality to alter the keymap" title="Lien direct vers Keyboard shortcut editor with the necessary functionality to alter the keymap">​</a></h3><p>Depending on the interfaces of KeymapService, the Keyboard shortcut editor allows the user to,</p><ul><li>View all the available commands and their respective keyboard shortcuts</li><li>Change, or disable a keyboard shortcut for some command</li><li>Restore a keyboard shortcut to its default value</li><li>Export all changes to a keymap file (in JSON format)</li><li>Import changes from an exported keymap file</li><li>Perform a simple search to locate some shortcut</li></ul><p>Changes performed to the keymap will be reflected immediately in the &nbsp;application user-interface as well as in the keymap file located in the &nbsp;profile directory. The editor will also perform continuous validation to &nbsp;ensure that the keymap will not enter a dirty-state.

Naveen has made an excellent job implementing various search engine features, including advanced filters, support for Okapi BM25 scoring algorithm, and fuzzy search. Here is what he has to say:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-got-done">What got done<a href="#what-got-done" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers What got done" title="Lien direct vers What got done">​</a></h3><p>The project consisted of three parts:</p><ol><li>Make search better by introducing additional search filters. (e.g., tags, notebook, type)</li><li>Make the ranking of search results better by implementing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Okapi BM25</a> relevance function.</li><li>Make fuzzy search possible.</li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="code-contributions">Code contributions<a href="#code-contributions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Code contributions" title="Lien direct vers Code contributions">​</a></h3><ol><li><a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/3213" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>All: Add search filters</strong></a>Joplin's search had been using the Full-Text Search(FTS) offered by &nbsp;SQLite directly. So though it was fast, it was not versatile. For &nbsp;example, we can't restrict the search scope to a particular notebook or &nbsp;search based on tags.The current search implementation fixes most of these problems. It &nbsp;provides a better abstraction over FTS, supporting many new filters. The &nbsp;documentation for the new search filters can be found <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin#searching" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/3454" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>All: Weigh notes using Okapi BM25 score</strong></a>Joplin used a ranking function based on the number of times the search query occurs in the note and how close they are.But there are better ways to rank notes, considering not just the &nbsp;number of times a word appears, but how common it is. Words like "the" &nbsp;is in most notes, while words like "zebra" are not common and should be &nbsp;considered more relevant.The new search implementation uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Okapi BM25</a> &nbsp;as the ranking function. It ranks a set of documents based on the query &nbsp;terms appearing in each document, regardless of their proximity.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/3632" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Desktop: Fuzzy search</strong></a>We've added support for fuzzy search. It doesn't replace the need to put &nbsp;* at the end if you want to do a prefix search. But it does let you be a &nbsp;bit more relaxed about the exact spelling. Searching for "tomatos" will &nbsp;also give you results for "tomatoes". (This feature isn't released yet, &nbsp;but will be soon)</li></ol><p>It has been a pleasure working with Laurent and Caleb. They did an excellent job as mentors.</p><p>I hope these new features will be useful to many people. I plan to &nbsp;continue as a member of the Joplin community and help in whatever way I &nbsp;can.</p>]]></content>

When you startup the app you will be asked &nbsp;to upgrade before being able to sync. Once you start the process, the &nbsp;app will briefly display an information screen, upgrade the sync target, &nbsp;and then restart the app. You’ll then be able to sync with the new sync &nbsp;target format. That first upgrade is quite simple as the goal for now &nbsp;is to put the mechanism in place and verify that it works well.</p><p>From a user perspective this feature doesn’t do anything visible, although <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/3692#issuecomment-685679213" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it caused some issues</a>, so one might wonder why it’s even there. This post is meant to clarify this.</p><p>The structure of the sync target hasn’t really changed since the day &nbsp;Joplin was released. It works well however it has some shortcomings that &nbsp;should be fixed eventually for sync to remain performant.</p><p>There are also various improvements that could be made but were not &nbsp;previously possible due to the lack of an upgrade mechanism. I have &nbsp;listed below the 5 main limitations or issues with the current sync &nbsp;process and how they could be fixed:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="no-upper-limit-on-the-number-of-items">No upper limit on the number of items<a href="#no-upper-limit-on-the-number-of-items" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers No upper limit on the number of items" title="Lien direct vers No upper limit on the number of items">​</a></h3><p>Joplin’s UI works well even with millions of notes, however the sync &nbsp;target will keep getting slower and slower as more files are added to &nbsp;it. File systems often have a limit to the number of files they can &nbsp;support in a directory. One user also has reached <a href="https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/limit-on-the-number-of-child-items-was-reached/3804" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the limit of 150,000 items on OneDrive</a>.</p><p>For now, this is not a big issue because most users don’t have &nbsp;millions of items, but as more web pages are being clipped (clipped &nbsp;pages often contain many small resources and images) and more note &nbsp;revisions are created (one note can have hundreds of revisions), this &nbsp;issue might start affecting more users.</p><p>One way to solve this issue would be to split the sync items into &nbsp;multiple directories. For example if we split the main directory into &nbsp;100 sub-directories, it will be possible to have 15,000,000 OneDrive &nbsp;items instead of 150,000. Another way would be to support note &nbsp;archiving, as described below. How exactly we’ll handle this problem is &nbsp;still to be defined, but there are certainly ways.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="not-possible-to-prioritise-downloads">Not possible to prioritise downloads<a href="#not-possible-to-prioritise-downloads" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Not possible to prioritise downloads" title="Lien direct vers Not possible to prioritise downloads">​</a></h3><p>Currently, when syncing, the items are downloaded in a random way. So &nbsp;it might download some notes, then some tags and notebooks, then back &nbsp;to downloading notes, etc. For small sync operations it doesn’t matter, &nbsp;but large ones, like when setting up a new device, it is very &nbsp;inefficient. For example, the app might download hundreds of note &nbsp;revisions or tags, but won’t display anything for a while because it &nbsp;won’t have downloaded notebooks or notes.</p><p>A simple improvement would be to group the items by type on the sync &nbsp;target. So all notebook items together, all tags together, etc. Doing so &nbsp;means when syncing we can first download the notebooks, then the notes, &nbsp;which means something will be displayed almost immediately in the app, &nbsp;allowing the user to start using it. Then later less important items &nbsp;like tags or note revisions will be downloaded.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="end-to-end-encryption-is-hard-to-setup">End-to-end encryption is hard to setup<a href="#end-to-end-encryption-is-hard-to-setup" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers End-to-end encryption is hard to setup" title="Lien direct vers End-to-end encryption is hard to setup">​</a></h3><p>Currently, the encryption settings is a property of the clients. What &nbsp;it means it that when you setup a new client, it doesn’t know whether &nbsp;the other clients use encryption or not. It’s going to guess more or &nbsp;less based on the data on the sync target. You can also force it to use &nbsp;encryption but this has drawbacks and often mean a new master key is &nbsp;going to be created, even though there might already be one on the sync &nbsp;target.</p><p>E2EE works well once it’s setup, but doing so can be tricky and possibly confusing - if you didn’t follow <a href="https://joplinapp.org/e2ee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this guide</a> to the letter, you might end up with multiple master keys, or sending decrypted notes to an encrypted target.</p><p>A way to solve this would be to make the E2EE settings a property of &nbsp;the sync target. Concretely there would be a file that tells if E2EE is &nbsp;enabled or not, and maybe some way to quickly get the master key. It &nbsp;would simplify setting up encryption a lot and make it more secure &nbsp;(because you won’t be able to send non-encrypted notes to an encrypted &nbsp;sync target). When you setup a new client, the client will know &nbsp;immediately if it’s an encrypted target or not and set the client &nbsp;accordingly.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="old-notes-that-never-change-should-be-handled-differently">Old notes that never change should be handled differently<a href="#old-notes-that-never-change-should-be-handled-differently" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Old notes that never change should be handled differently" title="Lien direct vers Old notes that never change should be handled differently">​</a></h3><p>It would be more efficient to treat old notes differently by allowing &nbsp;the user to “archive” them. An archived note would be read-only. Then &nbsp;one idea could be to group all these archived notes into a ZIP file on &nbsp;the sync target. Doing so means that the initial sync would be much &nbsp;faster (instead of downloading hundred of small files, which is slow, it &nbsp;will download one large file, which is fast). It would also make the &nbsp;structure more scalable - you could keep several years of archived notes &nbsp;on the sync target while keeping sync fast and efficient.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-resource-directory-should-be-renamed">The resource directory should be renamed<a href="#the-resource-directory-should-be-renamed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers The resource directory should be renamed" title="Lien direct vers The resource directory should be renamed">​</a></h3><p>The folder that contains file attachments is named “.resources” on &nbsp;the sync target. This causes troubles because certain platforms will &nbsp;hide directories that start with dot “.”, and perhaps they will be &nbsp;excluded from backup or skipped when moved somewhere else. Being able to &nbsp;upgrade the sync target means we can rename this folder to just &nbsp;“resources” instead.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Conclusion" title="Lien direct vers Conclusion">​</a></h3><p>That’s obviously a lot of possible improvements and it won’t be done &nbsp;overnight, but having the sync upgrade mechanism in place means we can &nbsp;start considering these options. Some of these, such as renaming the &nbsp;“resources” dir are simpler and could be done relatively soon. Perhaps &nbsp;other more complex ones will be group within one sync target upgrade to &nbsp;minimise disruption. In any case, I hope this clarifies the reason for &nbsp;this recent sync upgrade and that it gives some ideas of what to expect &nbsp;in the future.</p>]]></content>

To do this, click on the attachment or, if it's an image, right-click on it and select open. The file will then be watched by the application and any change you make will be saved to Joplin, and synchronised.</p><p><strong>New Markdown editor</strong></p><p>A new Markdown editor (Code Mirror) is now included with Joplin. For now it is for beta testing only so you need to manually enable it in the options in "Note" =<!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> "Use CodeMirror as the code editor". The goal of this new editor is to address several of the issues that have affected the previous Markdown editor and that were either hard or impossible to fix, in particular:</p><ul><li>Support for spell checking. Note that it is not yet implemented in the new editor but it at least can be done now.</li><li>Variable font size. The previous editor would not allow this, which would cause various issues.</li><li>Search within the Markdown text. Previously it was only possible to searched with the note viewer but with this editor it should be possible to search within the Markdown text too.</li><li>Improved support for emojis.</li><li>Improved support for Asian languages and Russian.</li></ul><p>If possible, please help test this new editor and <a href="https://discourse.joplinapp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report any issue in the forum</a>! (or GitHub)</p><p><strong>Manual ordering of notes</strong></p><p>You can now manually order the notes within the notebook. For this to work, make sure you choose "Custom order" in the menu View =<!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> Sort Notes by</p><p><strong>Support for system keychain on macOS and Windows</strong></p><p>One of the issues mentioned in the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/joplin-informal-35719724" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">security audit</a> was that certain sensitive settings, like Nextcloud or encryption passwords were saved unencrypted in the Joplin profile. This new release will make use of the system keychain when it is available and move the sensitive settings to it. You don't need to do anything to make use of this feature, it is automatically enabled in this release.</p><p>Currently this is supported on macOS and Windows. It is disabled of course for the portable version, and is also not currently enabled for Linux due to a build issue and less consistent support than on macOS and Windows.</p><p><strong>Support for system theme</strong></p><p>The app can now auto-detect the system theme and switch to it automatically. This essentially adds support for system "dark mode", which are now common on most operating systems. You may choose a preferred "light" theme and "dark" theme in the option.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20200607-112720_0.png" class="img_ev3q"></p>]]></content>

So congratulation to <a href="https://discourse.joplinapp.org/u/naviji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@naviji</a> &nbsp;and <a href="https://discourse.joplinapp.org/u/anjulalk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@anjulalk</a> &nbsp;! We’re glad to have you on board, and looking forward for the &nbsp;improvements you’re going to make as part of your projects on, &nbsp;respectively, the <strong>search engine</strong> and the <strong>keyboard shortcut editor</strong>! We’ll be in touch to give you more info on what happens next.</p><p>On our side, this is our first GSoC and we learnt quite a bit in the &nbsp;process. We got feedback from the students and we’re definitely taking &nbsp;it on board. One key point is that we didn’t expect Joplin to get that &nbsp;much interest as this is a relatively new project, and as a result we &nbsp;had trouble managing the number of proposals and pull requests we got. &nbsp;We also quickly ran out of “Good first issues”, which means for students &nbsp;coming a bit late it wasn’t clear what you could work on.</p><p>So next year, we’ll restrict a bit the number and the type of pull &nbsp;requests each student can make. Ideally we’d prefer if you work on only &nbsp;one or two medium-sized pull requests, rather than several small ones, &nbsp;so that you can really focus on it and give your best work. Of course, &nbsp;that makes it also more manageable for us as there will be less pull &nbsp;requests to review. I wasn’t too happy with the way I was reviewing &nbsp;sometimes, giving short and not very helpful comments at time, as I was &nbsp;trying to get as many PRs done as possible. Instead it would be best to &nbsp;do less but do it better.</p><p>Another point is that we should make it clear how many slots we’re &nbsp;likely to get. We cannot know for sure, it’s up to Google, but we can at &nbsp;least give an estimate. That way, you can decide whether it makes sense &nbsp;to invest your time in the project, or if it would be best to pick a &nbsp;different, less busy project.</p><p>In any case, this is a learning process for all, and we aim to improve over time.</p><p>Also a quick update on the number of pull requests - so far we have reviewed and processed 104 pull requests for GSoC (59 of which were merged) and there are still 32 pull requests that need to be reviewed and merged. So that's a lot of improvements and bug fixes on Joplin in the coming weeks.</p><p>Many thanks to all the students who joined us this year! We &nbsp;definitely appreciate your time and contribution on this project, &nbsp;whether it’s with your pull requests or via your participation on the &nbsp;forum, and you’re of course welcome to give it another try next year, or &nbsp;to stay around in the community.</p><p>Also many thanks to our mentors <a href="https://discourse.joplinapp.org/u/packelend" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@PackElend</a>, <a href="https://discourse.joplinapp.org/u/bedwardly-down" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@bedwardly-down</a>, <a href="https://discourse.joplinapp.org/u/mic704b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@mic704b</a>, <a href="https://discourse.joplinapp.org/u/tessus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@tessus</a>, <a href="https://discourse.joplinapp.org/u/calebjohn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@CalebJohn</a>, <a href="https://discourse.joplinapp.org/u/rullzer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@rullzer</a> for their help coordinating all this, writing the documentation and reviewing pull request and proposals!</p>]]></content>

In particular you can perform two operations:</p><ul><li>Upgrade the master key: This will convert the master key encryption to CCM</li><li>Re-encryption: With this tool, you can re-encrypt all your data using the new encryption method based on CCM. Please follow the instructions on this screen and note that this process can take quite a bit of time so it's better to plan for it and run it over night.

Indeed, the previous encryption method was using 1,000 key expansion iterations every time a note was encrypted, which is unnecessary since the master key is already secured with 10,000 iterations. As a result the encryption algorithm has been changed to perform only 100 iterations when encrypting notes, which should result in faster encryption and decryption on the desktop, mobile and CLI applications.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="unnecessary-and-potentially-insecure-master-key-checksum">Unnecessary and potentially insecure master key checksum<a href="#unnecessary-and-potentially-insecure-master-key-checksum" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Unnecessary and potentially insecure master key checksum" title="Lien direct vers Unnecessary and potentially insecure master key checksum">​</a></h3><blockquote><p>I was looking through your encryption implementation for Joplin and I have a few comments and concerns.

Joplin already includes robust HTML-to-MD and MD-to-HTML conversion modules (battle tested respectively in the web clipper and the desktop/mobile client), and this new editor is based on this technology. It is possible however that there are various edge cases that I have not thought of.</p><p>Thus your support to test and validate (or invalidate) this idea would be very much appreciated! If it turns out it does not make sense technically to support this editor, for example if some bugs are critical and can't be solved, it might be removed at a later date, but hopefully all bugs will be fixable. <strong>Please report issues you might find on GitHub,</strong> <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/176" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>on this post</strong></a>. In there, there's also a list of features that remains to be implemented.</p><p>At the moment, the feature is a bit hidden. <strong>To enable it, go into the menu View =<!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> Layout button sequence, and choose "Split / WYSIWYG"</strong>. Then click on the Layout button to toggle between modes.</p><p><strong>Missing features</strong></p><p>Some features are missing, most notably the ability to insert plugin blocks such as Katex or Mermaid, so you would have to create them first in the split view. Once created, they can however be edited.</p><p>One issue to be aware of, one that cannot be easily fixed, is that <strong>some Markdown plugins are not supported by the editor</strong>. This is because once the Markdown is converted to HTML, and displayed in the WYSIWYG editor, it cannot be converted back to the original Markdown. Some plugins are supported, such as Katex, Fountain or Mermaid. But others are not, like the multi-md table. So if you open a note that contains a multi-md table in the WYSIWYG editor and save, the original multi-md Markdown will be lost, and you'll get back a plain Markdown table.</p><p>Again if you find any issue, please report it on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/176" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/176</a></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20200314-001555_1.gif" class="img_ev3q"></p>]]></content>

We also try to fix any reported security issue as quickly as possible.</p><p>This release in particular includes a fix to an XSS vulnerability, which could have allowed an attacker, via a targetted attack and a specially crafted note, to exfiltrate user data. As far as we are aware, this flaw had not been exploited yet.</p><p>Finally, the geolocation service on the desktop application was previously using an http service to get the user location. We now use instead an https URL, which will increase privacy.</p><p><strong>Linux</strong></p><p>It is often more difficult to keep up with Linux due to the wide variety of distributions, desktop environments, and the differences between them from one version to the next.</p><p>We however try to keep it stable, and regularly get fixes and updates from Linux users. This release includes support for the --no-sandbox flag, required to get the app starting on certain systems, and an optimisation to Nextcloud and WebDAV sync, which could previously be very slow, using persistent connections.</p><p>The update is already available as a pre-release <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/releases/tag/v1.0.187" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the GitHub release page</a>, and should be available as a final release soon.</p>]]></content>

The application period as organisation is expected to happen in the second half of January 2020. Until then Joplin hopes to have multiple active discussion and may even have some easy commits in regard to the application and potential projects.</p><p>For those who don’t know, GSoC is a summer internship sponsored by Google, where <strong>open source organisations get full-time students as interns</strong> (paid by Google) to help take care of tasks. It’s a huge boon to many open source projects, allowing potentially some impressive progress to take place, and therefore many organisations try to qualify.</p><p>In order to apply, we'd need:</p><ul><li><strong>A list of good task suggestions for students</strong>. These tasks need to be things that can be realistically done by someone working full-time over a single summer. Students can suggest other tasks, but we are going to provide some suggestions.</li><li><strong>People volunteering to mentor a student.</strong> Mentoring requires continuous communication and contact with the student, as well as responding to requests and questions. I’ve mentored in the past, and it’s a fun experience.</li></ul><p>Fell free to make a suggestion or offer support by creating topics in the <a href="https://discourse.joplinapp.org/c/features" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Features category</a> of the forum and tagging them by <strong>#GSoC</strong> and <strong>#2020</strong>, if it is directly related to the upcoming coding season. More details on how to contribute will be published soon.</p><p>In general, Google wants to know that its money is put to good use, so we, as the Joplin community, need to show active involvement in this, leading to a solid schedule of desired deliverables during the coding phase.</p><p>The GSoC application is managed by <strong>@PackElend</strong>. He is an open source enthusiast with a big believe in a fair economy. He has recognised that Joplin has the potential to become one of the best note taking apps, and he sees the GSoC has a great opportunity to bring certain essential features to Joplin. PackElend mentored students in the past for another project and thus is aware of the pitfalls. He would appreciate if he could get support in giving the documentation the final touch.</p>]]></content>

It also works well inside circles (for Android) and square shapes.</p><p>Over the next few weeks, the icon and logo will be updated in the various apps and websites. That will give an opportunity to refresh the icons used throughout the apps, as several of them have incorrect dimensions, in particular on desktop and Android.</p><p>For information, this was the final tally, with Patreon and forum votes combined, with more weight (2 points) given to the first choice:</p><p>A 30</p><p>B 45</p><p>C 115</p><p>D 135</p><p>E 61</p><p>Many thanks to everyone who's contributed to the votes and discussion!</p>]]></content>

The applications (desktop, mobile and CLI) now preserve previous versions of the notes, so you can inspect or restore them later on as needed.</p><p>A common complain with many sync-based note taking apps is that they work in an opaque way - sometimes notes are changed or they disappear and it's not clear why - it could be a user error, or some bug, but regardless it makes it hard to trust the app with thousands of notes. So this feature give transparency over what's happening - if some note seems to be gone or changed when it shouldn't, the redundant data allows investigating the issue and restoring content.</p><p>Another medium term goal is to allow the implementation of a recycle bin. Behind the scene, this is essentially already done since whenever a note is deleted, a final revision of that note is preserved. What's missing is a user interface (i.e. the recycle bin) to view these deleted notes.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?<a href="#how-does-it-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers How does it work?" title="Lien direct vers How does it work?">​</a></h3><p>All the apps save a version of the modified notes every 10 minutes. These revisions are then synced across all the devices so if you're looking for a particular version of a note that was made on mobile, you can later find that version on the desktop app too.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-view-the-history-of-a-note">How to view the history of a note?<a href="#how-to-view-the-history-of-a-note" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers How to view the history of a note?" title="Lien direct vers How to view the history of a note?">​</a></h3><p>While all the apps save revisions, currently only the desktop one allow viewing these revisions.</p><p>To do so, click on the Information icon in the toolbar, then select "Previous version of this note".</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20190523-221026_0.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The next screen will show the latest version of the note. You can then choose to view a different version, if any, or to restore one of them.</p><p>To restore a note, simply click on the "Restore" button. The old version of the note will be copied in a folder called "Restored Notes". The current version of the note will not be replaced or modified.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20190523-221026_1.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-configure-the-note-history-feature">How to configure the note history feature?<a href="#how-to-configure-the-note-history-feature" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers How to configure the note history feature?" title="Lien direct vers How to configure the note history feature?">​</a></h3><p>Additional options are available in the "Note History" section of the configuration screen. It is possible to enable/disable the note history feature. It is also possible to specify for how long the history of a note should be kept (by default, for 90 days).</p><p>IMPORTANT: Please note that since all the revisions are synced across all devices, it means these settings are kind of global. So for example, if on one device you set it to keep revisions for 30 days, and on another to 100 days, the revisions older than 30 days will be deleted, and then this deletion will be synced. So in practice it means revisions are kept for whatever is the minimum number of days as set on any of the devices. In that particular case, the 100 days setting will be essentially ignored, and only the 30 days one will apply.</p>]]></content>

Before this, the only way to discuss the project was indeed on the GitHub bug tracker, which is not ideal for general discussion about features, development and so on.</p><p>After looking at various options, eventually we settled on Discourse, which provides a nice clean UI, works well on mobile, and is easy to manage. Even better, the Discourse team was kind enough to host the project for us for free, as part of their <a href="https://blog.discourse.org/2016/03/free-discourse-forum-hosting-for-community-friendly-github-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Free hosting program for open source projects</a>. Not having to manage or pay for the server is great, and it means more time can be spent developing the application.</p><p>On the opening day, there was only three users - me, foxmask and zblesk, joined a few days later by tessus, merlinuwe, jhf2442, sciurius and many others. Today there are 811 users, 6700 posts, about 15 new posts created each day, and about 2000 pageviews each day.</p><p>The forum has been very useful to discuss features and development, to provide support and news, and to organise <a href="https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/joplin-and-hacktobertfest-2018/752" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">events such as Hacktoberfest</a>. It also serves as a knowledge base (via the <a href="https://discourse.joplinapp.org/search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">search function</a>) to provide solutions regarding various Joplin issues.</p><p>Of course the forum has also been great to develop the community around the Joplin project, and hopefully will keep serving us well for the years to come!</p>]]></content>

For example if you search for "recipe cake" it would return results that contain exactly this word in this order and nothing else - it would not return "apple cake recipe" or "recipe for birthday cake", thus forcing you to try various queries.</p><p>The last versions of Joplin include a new search engine that provides much better results, and also allow better specifying search queries.</p><p>The search engine indexes in real time the content of the notes, thus it can give back results very fast. It is also built on top of SQLite FTS and thus support <a href="https://joplin.cozic.net/#searching" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all its queries</a>. Unlike the previous search engine, the new one also sorts the results by relevance.</p><p>The first iteration of this new search engine was a bit limited when it comes to non-English text. For example, for searching text that contains accents or non-alphabetical characters. So in the last update, better support for this was also added - accentuated and non-accentuated characters are treated in the same way, and languages like Russian, Chinese, Japanese or Korean can be searched easily.</p><p>This search engine is still new so it is likely to change over time. For example, ordering the results by relevance is a bit experimental, and some edge cases might not work for non-English language queries. If you notice any issue, feel free to report it on the forum or GitHub. The new search engine is in use in both the mobile and desktop application.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20190130-230218_0.png" class="img_ev3q"></p>]]></content>

Setting up Joplin synchronisation can be more complicated than other existing note applications, but the advantage is that once it is done you 100% own the data and even the infrastructure if you use Nextcloud on your own server.</p><p>The applications do not track users, and of course there is not and will never be ads. It also makes very few web requests (outside of synchronisation). In fact only two requests are made, and both can be disabled in the options:</p><ul><li><p>One for geolocation tagging, to associate a latitude and longitude with a note.</p></li><li><p>One for the auto-update checks. It makes a request to GitHub to check if a new version has been released.</p></li></ul><p>This endorsement by PrivacyTools is great news for the project.

A stable interface without too many glitches also makes for a more pleasant user experience. For these reasons, bug fixes are always given high priority in this project, and are usually worked on before any new feature is added. The latest release for instance pretty much only contains bug fixes - eight of them, including one security fix.</p><p>Joplin is not bug free yet, there are still a few issues here and there, that sometimes depend on the user's hardware or configuration, and others that are hard to replicate or fix, but the app is getting there - more stable with each new release.</p><p>More information about this release and download link in the changelog - <a href="https://joplin.cozic.net/changelog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://joplin.cozic.net/changelog/</a></p>]]></content>

However it eventually catches up, as is the case with the latest release, which includes all the features and bug fixes from the past few months.</p><p>In particular a feature that's been needed for a while - the ability to open resources (eg. PDF files or other attachments) in external viewers. That means all that's available in desktop - notes and attachments - is now also fully available on mobile, making the app much more useful. In this release there are also quite a few optimisations to the sync process so in some cases it should be faster, as well as better support for WebDAV. Finally there are various small fixes and improvements, such as support for SVG vector graphics, improved math formula support, etc.</p><p>All these improvements are also found in the recently released macOS, Windows, Linux and Android versions.</p>]]></content>
