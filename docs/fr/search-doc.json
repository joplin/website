You can also choose to have these notes permanently deleted after a number of days.  Support for the trash folder has a somewhat long history in Joplin since it's an obvious and important feature to add, yet it can be particularly tricky once you start realising how many parts of the app it's going to impact. Many attempts have been made over time: my first attempt was based on the note history feature. Indeed since this feature already saves versions of notes, it seems to make sense to use it for the trash feature, and indeed the note history feature was designed for this originally. However that approach turned to be needlessly complicated and after modifying hundreds of files just for this, the idea was dropped. The next one was based on using a special &quot;trash&quot; tag - deleted notes would have this tag attached to them and would appear in a special &quot;trash&quot; folder. This approach also had many issues probably the main one being that notebooks can't be tagged, which means we would have to add support for tagged notebooks and that in itself would also be a massive change. Various, ideas, were also attempted using plugins, by creating a special &quot;trash folder&quot;, but in the end no such plugin was ever created, probably due to limitations of the plugin API. In the end, turned out that this old idea of adding a &quot;deleted&quot; property to each note and notebook was the easiest approach. With this it was simpler to get to a working solution relatively quickly, and then it was a matter of ensuring that deleted notes don't appear where they shouldn't, such as search results, etc. ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Joplin Cloud multi-factor authentication​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Full changelogs","url":"/fr/news#joplin-cloud-multi-factor-authentication","content":"Multi-factor authentication (MFA), also known as two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security process that requires you to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a system or account.

The app was kindly submitted by Mats Estensen on GitHub and accepted soon after. Since day one the Joplin project has indeed been concerned with privacy - offering End To End Encryption and supporting open standards, including WebDAV for synchronisation. Setting up Joplin synchronisation can be more complicated than other existing note applications, but the advantage is that once it is done you 100% own the data and even the infrastructure if you use Nextcloud on your own server. The applications do not track users, and of course there is not and will never be ads. It also makes very few web requests (outside of synchronisation). In fact only two requests are made, and both can be disabled in the options: One for geolocation tagging, to associate a latitude and longitude with a note. One for the auto-update checks. It makes a request to GitHub to check if a new version has been released. This endorsement by PrivacyTools is great news for the project. It means more users, and that our efforts to create a privacy-respecting tool are going in the right direction.","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Markdown plugins and Goto Anything","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/fr/news/20190404-064157","content":" The latest release includes two relatively important new features: The first one, is the addition of several Markdown plugins that enable new features: for example it's now possible to add a table of contents to your notes, to enable footnotes, or to render various text decorations, such as superscript, subscript, highlighting, etc. This was all made possible thanks to the efforts of Caleb John. The second major new feature is the addition of the Goto Anything dialog. Press Ctrl+P or Cmd+P and type the title of a note to jump directly to it. You can also type # followed by a tag or @ followed by a notebook title.

Before this, the only way to discuss the project was indeed on the GitHub bug tracker, which is not ideal for general discussion about features, development and so on. After looking at various options, eventually we settled on Discourse, which provides a nice clean UI, works well on mobile, and is easy to manage. Even better, the Discourse team was kind enough to host the project for us for free, as part of their Free hosting program for open source projects. Not having to manage or pay for the server is great, and it means more time can be spent developing the application. On the opening day, there was only three users - me, foxmask and zblesk, joined a few days later by tessus, merlinuwe, jhf2442, sciurius and many others. Today there are 811 users, 6700 posts, about 15 new posts created each day, and about 2000 pageviews each day. The forum has been very useful to discuss features and development, to provide support and news, and to organise events such as Hacktoberfest. It also serves as a knowledge base (via the search function) to provide solutions regarding various Joplin issues. Of course the forum has also been great to develop the community around the Joplin project, and hopefully will keep serving us well for the years to come!","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"New search engine in Joplin","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/fr/news/20190130-230218","content":" The original search engine in Joplin was pretty limited - it would search for your exact query and that is it. For example if you search for &quot;recipe cake&quot; it would return results that contain exactly this word in this order and nothing else - it would not return &quot;apple cake recipe&quot; or &quot;recipe for birthday cake&quot;, thus forcing you to try various queries. The last versions of Joplin include a new search engine that provides much better results, and also allow better specifying search queries. The search engine indexes in real time the content of the notes, thus it can give back results very fast. It is also built on top of SQLite FTS and thus support all its queries. Unlike the previous search engine, the new one also sorts the results by relevance. The first iteration of this new search engine was a bit limited when it comes to non-English text. For example, for searching text that contains accents or non-alphabetical characters. So in the last update, better support for this was also added - accentuated and non-accentuated characters are treated in the same way, and languages like Russian, Chinese, Japanese or Korean can be searched easily. This search engine is still new so it is likely to change over time. For example, ordering the results by relevance is a bit experimental, and some edge cases might not work for non-English language queries. If you notice any issue, feel free to report it on the forum or GitHub. The new search engine is in use in both the mobile and desktop application.","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Changing attachment download behaviour to save disk space","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/fr/news/20190610-230711","content":" One issue that came up frequently in the forum is that Joplin's data can be very large, especially when the note collection includes many attachments (images, PDFs, etc.). This happens in particular when using the web clipper a lot, as each web page usually has many images included. The recent versions of Joplin (Desktop, mobile and CLI) attempt to mitigate this issue by providing an option to change how attachments are downloaded during synchronisation. The default option is to download all the attachments, all the time, so that the data is available even when the device is offline. However, more importantly, there's now the option to download the attachments manually, by clicking on it, or automatically, in which case the attachments are downloaded only when a note is opened. These changes should help saving disk space and network bandwidth, especially on mobile.","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Note history now in Joplin","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/fr/news/20190523-221026","content":"","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Customising your notes with the help of the development tools and CSS","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/fr/news/20190613-192613","content":" In Joplin desktop, it has been possible to customise the appearance of your notes using CSS for quite some time.

So for example, if on one device you set it to keep revisions for 30 days, and on another to 100 days, the revisions older than 30 days will be deleted, and then this deletion will be synced. So in practice it means revisions are kept for whatever is the minimum number of days as set on any of the devices.

Perhaps that's the best way - evolving and cleaning up the icon rather than radically changing it. Another advantage of this icon is that it does not represent any specific object (it's not a note, or notebook), so it does not restrict the scope of the project, which as it grows, is becoming more than just a tool to take notes. Finally, this icon scales well at different sizes, including down to 16x16 pixels which we need for tray icons. It also works well inside circles (for Android) and square shapes. Over the next few weeks, the icon and logo will be updated in the various apps and websites.

The application period as organisation is expected to happen in the second half of January 2020. Until then Joplin hopes to have multiple active discussion and may even have some easy commits in regard to the application and potential projects. For those who don’t know, GSoC is a summer internship sponsored by Google, where open source organisations get full-time students as interns (paid by Google) to help take care of tasks. It’s a huge boon to many open source projects, allowing potentially some impressive progress to take place, and therefore many organisations try to qualify. In order to apply, we'd need: A list of good task suggestions for students. These tasks need to be things that can be realistically done by someone working full-time over a single summer. Students can suggest other tasks, but we are going to provide some suggestions.People volunteering to mentor a student. Mentoring requires continuous communication and contact with the student, as well as responding to requests and questions. I’ve mentored in the past, and it’s a fun experience. Fell free to make a suggestion or offer support by creating topics in the Features category of the forum and tagging them by #GSoC and #2020, if it is directly related to the upcoming coding season. More details on how to contribute will be published soon. In general, Google wants to know that its money is put to good use, so we, as the Joplin community, need to show active involvement in this, leading to a solid schedule of desired deliverables during the coding phase. The GSoC application is managed by @PackElend. He is an open source enthusiast with a big believe in a fair economy. He has recognised that Joplin has the potential to become one of the best note taking apps, and he sees the GSoC has a great opportunity to bring certain essential features to Joplin.

As a result the encryption algorithm has been changed to perform only 100 iterations when encrypting notes, which should result in faster encryption and decryption on the desktop, mobile and CLI applications.

Now I did notice that you cache the plain text password in the database, which is a bit concerning, but I guess the security model of your encryption approach is that it happens during sync, not locally. The generally accepted approach [to store secrets] is to use a keychain service, which is available pretty much on all modern platforms. Passwords are indeed cached locally, so that you don't have to input it again every time a note needs to be encrypted or decrypted for synchronisation. It is assumed that your local device is secure, which is why for now passwords were cached locally. To improve security however, future versions of Joplin will use the system keychain whenever it is available. A pull request is in progress to add this feature. To conclude I'd like to thank Isaac Potoczny-Jones for conducting this audit and revealing these potential security issues. Joplin is now much safer as a result.

So congratulation to @naviji and @anjulalk ! We’re glad to have you on board, and looking forward for the improvements you’re going to make as part of your projects on, respectively, the search engine and the keyboard shortcut editor! We’ll be in touch to give you more info on what happens next. On our side, this is our first GSoC and we learnt quite a bit in the process. We got feedback from the students and we’re definitely taking it on board. One key point is that we didn’t expect Joplin to get that much interest as this is a relatively new project, and as a result we had trouble managing the number of proposals and pull requests we got. We also quickly ran out of “Good first issues”, which means for students coming a bit late it wasn’t clear what you could work on. So next year, we’ll restrict a bit the number and the type of pull requests each student can make. Ideally we’d prefer if you work on only one or two medium-sized pull requests, rather than several small ones, so that you can really focus on it and give your best work. Of course, that makes it also more manageable for us as there will be less pull requests to review. I wasn’t too happy with the way I was reviewing sometimes, giving short and not very helpful comments at time, as I was trying to get as many PRs done as possible. Instead it would be best to do less but do it better. Another point is that we should make it clear how many slots we’re likely to get. We cannot know for sure, it’s up to Google, but we can at least give an estimate. That way, you can decide whether it makes sense to invest your time in the project, or if it would be best to pick a different, less busy project. In any case, this is a learning process for all, and we aim to improve over time. Also a quick update on the number of pull requests - so far we have reviewed and processed 104 pull requests for GSoC (59 of which were merged) and there are still 32 pull requests that need to be reviewed and merged. So that's a lot of improvements and bug fixes on Joplin in the coming weeks. Many thanks to all the students who joined us this year! We definitely appreciate your time and contribution on this project, whether it’s with your pull requests or via your participation on the forum, and you’re of course welcome to give it another try next year, or to stay around in the community. Also many thanks to our mentors @PackElend, @bedwardly-down, @mic704b, @tessus, @CalebJohn, @rullzer for their help coordinating all this, writing the documentation and reviewing pull request and proposals!","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Experimental WYSIWYG editor in Joplin","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/fr/news/20200314-001555","content":" The latest pre-release of Joplin (v1.0.194) includes a new WYSIWYG editor, a prototype for now, but a first step towards integrating this feature into Joplin. WYSIWYG is probably the most requested feature in Joplin - it's the second most up-voted on GitHub, and one of the most viewed and commented on post in the forum. Please note however that this feature is experimental at this stage - don't use it for important notes as you may lose the content of the note, or it might get corrupted. If you are interested in this editor though it might make sense to use it for less important notes, so as to evaluate it and report bugs and issues you might find. This is a technically challenging component because it needs to convert between Markdown and HTML, and vice-versa. Joplin already includes robust HTML-to-MD and MD-to-HTML conversion modules (battle tested respectively in the web clipper and the desktop/mobile client), and this new editor is based on this technology. It is possible however that there are various edge cases that I have not thought of. Thus your support to test and validate (or invalidate) this idea would be very much appreciated! If it turns out it does not make sense technically to support this editor, for example if some bugs are critical and can't be solved, it might be removed at a later date, but hopefully all bugs will be fixable. Please report issues you might find on GitHub, on this post. In there, there's also a list of features that remains to be implemented. At the moment, the feature is a bit hidden. To enable it, go into the menu View =&gt; Layout button sequence, and choose &quot;Split / WYSIWYG&quot;. Then click on the Layout button to toggle between modes. Missing features Some features are missing, most notably the ability to insert plugin blocks such as Katex or Mermaid, so you would have to create them first in the split view. Once created, they can however be edited. One issue to be aware of, one that cannot be easily fixed, is that some Markdown plugins are not supported by the editor. This is because once the Markdown is converted to HTML, and displayed in the WYSIWYG editor, it cannot be converted back to the original Markdown. Some plugins are supported, such as Katex, Fountain or Mermaid. But others are not, like the multi-md table. So if you open a note that contains a multi-md table in the WYSIWYG editor and save, the original multi-md Markdown will be lost, and you'll get back a plain Markdown table.

You don't need to do anything to make use of this feature, it is automatically enabled in this release. Currently this is supported on macOS and Windows. It is disabled of course for the portable version, and is also not currently enabled for Linux due to a build issue and less consistent support than on macOS and Windows.

File systems often have a limit to the number of files they can support in a directory. One user also has reached the limit of 150,000 items on OneDrive. For now, this is not a big issue because most users don’t have millions of items, but as more web pages are being clipped (clipped pages often contain many small resources and images) and more note revisions are created (one note can have hundreds of revisions), this issue might start affecting more users. One way to solve this issue would be to split the sync items into multiple directories. For example if we split the main directory into 100 sub-directories, it will be possible to have 15,000,000 OneDrive items instead of 150,000.

For example, the app might download hundreds of note revisions or tags, but won’t display anything for a while because it won’t have downloaded notebooks or notes. A simple improvement would be to group the items by type on the sync target. So all notebook items together, all tags together, etc. Doing so means when syncing we can first download the notebooks, then the notes, which means something will be displayed almost immediately in the app, allowing the user to start using it.

E2EE works well once it’s setup, but doing so can be tricky and possibly confusing - if you didn’t follow this guide to the letter, you might end up with multiple master keys, or sending decrypted notes to an encrypted target. A way to solve this would be to make the E2EE settings a property of the sync target. Concretely there would be a file that tells if E2EE is enabled or not, and maybe some way to quickly get the master key. It would simplify setting up encryption a lot and make it more secure (because you won’t be able to send non-encrypted notes to an encrypted sync target).

For example, you can put the note list below the sidebar, to have more space for the text editor, move the sidebar to the right of the application, etc. To begin changing the application layout, click on &quot;Change application layout&quot; from the View menu: This will put the app into a special mode, from which you can move the side bar, note list and text editor around.

It means that when you install it you will no longer see a warning telling you that the app hasn't been checked for malware. You also won't need to go in the OS security settings to launch the app. Notarisation has been around since macOS Catalina, however it took a while to implement it for Joplin as the process is complex and error prone. First the app has to be built and uploaded to Apple's servers. They then automatically check the app for any malware, a process that can take 5 to 15 minutes (and presumably more if the app is incorrectly flagged as malware). Once it's done, Apple creates a notarisation ticket for the app. Then whenever the app is started, Apple check on their server if the app has a notarisation ticket (a process that recently caused &quot;apps taking minutes to launch, stuttering and non-responsiveness throughout macOS&quot;). It's also possible to staple this notarisation ticket to the app, so that it's possible to check the ticket even when the computer is offline. All that has now been automated in the Joplin build pipeline, and will apply to all macOS app future versions.","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Plugin support available in Joplin v1.4","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/fr/news/20201130-145937","content":" The plugin system has been part of Joplin since the previous version, however it was still a bit unstable.

It is not clear yet how this is going to be done, but one idea would be to have a GitHub repository where anyone could submit or update a plugin, then the app would connect to that repository to make it easy to install new plugins. This is just an idea at this point though, and if you have any suggestion on other ways it could be done, feel free to let me know.

I've done a basic test with Nextcloud and Joplin Server running on the same server. Both have mostly default settings (except Nextcloud which uses Redis for file locks):  Why is it so much faster? I assume it's in part because the WebDAV protocol is terribly inefficient. It sends unnecessarily large XML blobs for every request, which are time consuming to download and parse. It also doesn't support delta sync (unlike Joplin Server), which means the complete file list needs to be downloaded before syncing in order to compare the local and remote items. Finally it's possible that Nextcloud file locking system means an overhead on each request. It shouldn't be much since it's handled by Redis but who knows. Joplin Server doesn't need locking as data consistency is handled by the clients. So just by following common sense and transferring only the required data in a sane format (JSON), we can have something more performant. In my case, I appreciate that the mobile app no longer freezes when it starts synchronising - before it would do that due to the large XML WebDAV file that needs to be parsed.

It's been present since version 2.x and the feature is getting close to be stable. How does it work? When connected to Joplin Server (or the upcoming Joplin Cloud service), a new &quot;Share notebook&quot; menu item is available when right-clicking on a notebook. Click on it, and it will display a new dialog where you can add any number of recipients. Those recipients also need to be on the same Joplin Server instance. From this dialog you can also remove a recipient or unshare the whole notebook, in which case it will be removed from everybody's note collection, except yours. Once this is done, the recipient(s) will receive a notification in Joplin the next time they synchronise their data: Then, finally, once the invitation is accepted, Joplin will download all the shared notebooks and notes. A shared notebook is denoted by the usual Share icon. Now the invited user can read or modify the shared notes, add attachments, etc. and the changes will be visible to everyone with access to the notebook. What's the availability of the notebook sharing feature? The notebook sharing feature is available on Joplin Server and Joplin Cloud. On desktop, you can share notebooks and of course view or modify any notebook that has been shared with you. On mobile and CLI, you cannot currently share notebooks, but you can view or modify any notebook that has been shared with you. If I share a notebook with someone, what access do they have? Currently they have full access to the data, including reading, writing and deleting notebooks or notes. In a future version, access control might be implemented. For example, to only give read-only access to the shared notebook. What can actually be shared? All the sub-notebooks, notes and resources within the shared notebook are shared. Does it work with End-To-End-Encryption? Yes and no. It is possible to use the share notebook feature even with E2EE enabled, however any shared notebook or note will not be encrypted, otherwise you would have had to give your master key password to the people you share with, which you'd probably not want to do. In a future version, this might be supported. For example by automatically creating a new master key for the shared notebook. You would then provide the recipients with that master key password. What can it be used for? Some ideas: Plan a trip with friends or within a small organisation. For example, the notes could contain the maps, hotel and flight reservations, etc. or any document or note relevant to the trip. And all participants would have access to them.Work on a project with colleagues. Everybody can access various work-related documents, add to them, modify them, etc. That could serve as a knowledge base for a project.Another possible use, which has been requested many times, is to support multiple profiles. You could create a main profile that have access to all notes, and in there create a Work and Personal notebook. Then you would create a separate account for work. You can then share your Work notebook with that other account. That way the work account will only have access to the Work notebooks. You can use this technique in various ways to split your notebooks between multiple accounts and ensure strict separation between datasets.","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Poll: What's the size of your note collection?","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/fr/news/20210624-171844","content":" Poll is on the forum: https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/poll-whats-the-size-of-your-note-collection/18191","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Any ideas for a Joplin tagline?","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/fr/news/20210705-094247","content":" I'm going to update the website front page to better showcase the application.

Recommended plugins will also appear on top when searching. For now, since we don't have a review process, the recommended plugins are those developed by the Joplin team and frequent contributors, because we know those are safe to use. Later we might have a review process and add more recommended plugins. That being said, in the meantime even if a plugin is not marked as recommended, there's a good chance it is still safe and have good performance too.

Of course Joplin still supports other sync options such as Nextcloud, Dropbox and OneDrive or AWS S3. You can also self host using Joplin Server. The advantage of Joplin Cloud being that you don't need to maintain a server yourself - for a small fee you'll get that taken care of. Additionally, subscribing to Joplin Cloud is a great way to support the project as a whole, including the open source applications. Such support is needed in the long term to provide bug and security fixes, add new features, and provide support. At some level it is also an experiment, to see if such a service is financially viable and can allow me to work full time on the project.

The goal is to make it easier to use, to make it more reliable and to support the future use case of sharing encrypted notebooks or notes. One important change is the support for a master password. This single password will be responsible to encrypt various keys, including some that will be automatically generated. Thanks to this, it won't be necessary to ask to enter a new password every time a key needs to be encrypted, since the master password can be used. It will also be easier to manage since you'll only have one password to remember instead of a different one for each notebook you might have shared. Finally, it's now possible to disable a master key. What it means is that it will no longer show up in the list of master keys, and will also no longer generate a warning asking you to enter the password. In some case you might have forgotten it and no longer need it key, so you can now disable it.

One of the database migration is going to add an &quot;owner_id&quot; column to the &quot;items&quot; table (where all notes, notebooks, etc. are stored), and automatically populate it. Normally that shouldn't take too long but you might want to make sure you won't need the server right away when you process this. The second database migration will add a unique constraint on items.name and items.owner_id and that's where the breaking change might be. Normally this data is already unique because that's enforced by the application but in some rare cases, due a race condition, there could be duplicate data in there. If that happens the migration will fail and the server will not start. If that happens, you'll need to decide what to do with the data, as it's not possible to automatically decide. You can find all duplicates using this query: **select** count(*), name, owner_id**from** items **group** **by** name, owner_id**having** count(*) &gt; 1; Once you have the list of IDs you have a few options: Find the corresponding item in Joplin (it can unfortunately be anything - a note, resource, folder, etc.), then delete it and sync.Or, just delete the data directly in the database. You'll want to delete the corresponding item_id from the user_items table too. But really in most cases you should be fine.

In practice such a feature allows third-party application to interact with Joplin by creating links that can be opened from outside.

Later on, these keys will be used to allow sharing encrypted notebooks. The second goal of these E2EE changes is to simplify the system enough that it can be enabled by default.

The most visible one is the addition of a sort button above the note list - it allows sorting by modification date, creation date, title or by custom order, in either ascending or descending order: By default, this sort order is going to apply to all notebooks, however you can now also assign a per-notebook sort order. In this case, any sort order will be apply to that notebook only. To enable this behaviour, simply right-click on a notebook and select &quot;Toggle own sort order&quot;: Thanks to Kenichi Kobayashi for developing this feature! Support for notebook icons It is now possible to associate icons with notebooks no both the desktop and mobile applications. To do so, right-click on a notebook and selected &quot;Edit&quot;. This will open the new notebook dialog from which can change the title and assign an icon. For now the icons are emojis but perhaps custom icons could be supported later on. Allow collaborating on encrypted notebooks using Joplin Cloud Thanks to the encryption improvements in the previous Joplin versions it is now possible to share and collaborated on encrypted notebooks, when synchronising with Joplin Cloud (or Joplin Server). To get this working, you and the recipient will need to have Joplin 2.6 and the person who shares will need to have encryption enabled. After that most of the process is handled automatically by the apps - in particular it will automatically generate and share the required encryption keys for each users. Improved synchronisation startup speed Synchronisation is also a bit faster in this release due to an optimisation on the startup process. When syncing, the app needs to acquire a lock, which may be time consuming since it requires making multiple requests. This has now been optimised so that less requests are necessary and also each request consumes less resources. This will have a positive impact on Joplin Cloud in particular, but you should also see improvements with Joplin Server and smaller improvements with the other sync targets. Improved Markdown editor split view scrolling Kenichi Kobayashi made some great improvements to the Markdown editor scrolling in this release. The issue before was that the editor on the left and the viewer on the right would often not be in sync, in particular if the note contains several images and other media. With Kenichi's change the editor and viewer stay nicely in sync, regardless of the note content. In fact it looks a bit like magic when you scroll through large notes - notice in particular how each side appear to wait for the other or speed up in order to make sure both sides are aligned as well possible. Kenichi provides a nice technical documentation about the feature here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wbs5XZR0oeU Improved and optimised S3 synchronisation Thanks to the efforts of Lee Matos, synchronisation with S3 is now more reliable and errors are also better handled. The underlying S3 SDK has also been upgraded from v2 to v3 which results in a smaller executable size (about 3-5 MB depending on the operating system) Export notes as self-contained HTML files Exporting a single note as HTML is now more user friendly as all images, scripts, styles and other attachments are all packed into a single HTML file (Previously it would create multiples files and directories). This makes it easier to share the complete note with someone who doesn't have Joplin. Other changes and bug fixes This release includes a total of 19 new features and improvements and 16 bug fixes.

This Renovate tool is a way to manage dependencies - it automatically finds what needs to be updated, then upgrade it to the latest version, and create a pull request. If all tests pass, we can then merge this pull request. So far we have merged 267 of these pull requests. Updating Joplin packages was long due. It is necessary so that we don't fall behind and end up using unsupported or deprecated packages. We also benefit from bug fixes and performance improvements. It is also important in terms of security, since recent package versions usually include various security fixes. We used to rely on a tool called &quot;npm audit&quot; to do this, however it no longer works on the Joplin codebase, and it was always risky to use it since it would update multiple packages in one command - so if something went wrong it was difficult to find the culprit. Renovate on the other hand upgrades packages one at a time, and run our test units to ensure everything is still working as expected. It also upgrades multiple instances of the same package across the monorepo, which is convenient to keep our code consistent. It also has a number of options to make our life easier, such as the ability to automatically merge a pull request for patch releases since this is usually safe (when a package is, for example upgraded from 1.0.1 to 1.0.3). Although Renovate automates the package upgrades it doesn't mean all upgrades are straightforward - our tests won't catch all issues, so the apps might end up being broken or cannot be compiled anymore. So there's manual work involved to get everything working after certain upgrades - for the most part this has been done and the apps appear to be stable so far. This will however be an important part of pre-release 2.10 (or should it be 3.0?) - we hope that everything works but we may need your support to try this version and report any glitch you may have found.

It looks good and it's even interactive! (You can click to collapse/expand blocks of text) But unfortunately it doesn't scale to large workflows, like we have for Joplin - the log can freeze and it will take forever to search for something. Indeed searching is done in &quot;real time&quot;... which mostly means it will freeze for a minute or two for each letter you type in the search box. Not great. Thankfully GitHub provides an alternative access: the raw logs. This is much better because they will open as plain text, without any styling or JS magic, which means you can use the browser native search and it will be fast. But now the problem is that raw logs look like this: While it's not impossible to read, all colours that would display nicely in a terminal are gone and replaced by ANSI codes. You can find what you need in there but it's not particularly easy. This is where the new GitHub Action Raw Log Viewer extension for Chrome can help. It will parse your raw log and convert the ANSI codes to proper colours.

This includes the discussion of issues on GitHub, as well as the submission of pull requests and related discussions. The transparency of these processes allows for collaborative problem-solving and shared insights. However, there is one aspect that operates behind closed doors, and for good reason: addressing cybersecurity vulnerabilities. It is imperative that these issues remain undisclosed until they have been resolved. Once a solution is implemented, it is usually accompanied by discreet commits and a message in the changelog to signify the progress made. Typically, the process begins with an email from a security researcher. They provide valuable insights, such as a specially crafted note that triggers a bug, or an API call, along with an explanation of how the application's security can be circumvented. We examine the vulnerability, create a fix, and create automated test units to prevent any accidental reintroduction of the vulnerability in future code updates. An example of such a commit is: 9e90d9016daf79b5414646a93fd369aedb035071 We then share our fix with the researcher for validation. Additionally, we often apply the fix to previous versions of Joplin, depending on the severity of the vulnerability. The contribution of security researchers in this regard is immeasurable. They employ their ingenuity to identify inventive methods of bypassing existing security measures and often discover subtle flaws in the code that might otherwise go unnoticed. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the security researchers who have assisted us throughout the years in identifying and rectifying security vulnerabilities! @Alise@hexodotsh@ly1g3@maple3142Ademar Nowasky JuniorBenjamin HarrisJavier OlmedoJubair Rehman Yousafzailin@UCCU HackerpersonalizedrefrigeratorPhil HolbrookRyotaKYaniv Nizry Discuss on the forum","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"What's new in Joplin 2.13","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/fr/news/20231204-release-2-13","content":"","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Desktop​","type":1,"pageTitle":"What's new in Joplin 2.13","url":"/fr/news/20231204-release-2-13#desktop","content":"","version":null,"tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Rich Text Editor improvements​","type":1,"pageTitle":"What's new in Joplin 2.13","url":"/fr/news/20231204-release-2-13#rich-text-editor-improvements","content":"In this update, significant enhancements have been implemented in the Rich Text Editor to enhance user experience.

You can also choose to have these notes permanently deleted after a number of days.  Support for the trash folder has a somewhat long history in Joplin since it's an obvious and important feature to add, yet it can be particularly tricky once you start realising how many parts of the app it's going to impact. Many attempts have been made over time: my first attempt was based on the note history feature. Indeed since this feature already saves versions of notes, it seems to make sense to use it for the trash feature, and indeed the note history feature was designed for this originally. However that approach turned to be needlessly complicated and after modifying hundreds of files just for this, the idea was dropped. The next one was based on using a special &quot;trash&quot; tag - deleted notes would have this tag attached to them and would appear in a special &quot;trash&quot; folder. This approach also had many issues probably the main one being that notebooks can't be tagged, which means we would have to add support for tagged notebooks and that in itself would also be a massive change. Various, ideas, were also attempted using plugins, by creating a special &quot;trash folder&quot;, but in the end no such plugin was ever created, probably due to limitations of the plugin API. In the end, turned out that this old idea of adding a &quot;deleted&quot; property to each note and notebook was the easiest approach. With this it was simpler to get to a working solution relatively quickly, and then it was a matter of ensuring that deleted notes don't appear where they shouldn't, such as search results, etc. ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Joplin Cloud multi-factor authentication​","type":1,"pageTitle":"What's new in Joplin 3.0","url":"/fr/news/20240701-release-3-0#joplin-cloud-multi-factor-authentication","content":"Multi-factor authentication (MFA), also known as two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security process that requires you to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a system or account.

To better secure your account, Joplin Cloud and all Joplin applications now support MFA. To enable it, go to your Joplin Cloud profile, click on &quot;Enable multi-factor authentication&quot; and follow the instructions.

Normally the app should not offer you to install a non-working plugin but that may still happen. In general if you notice any issue with this beta feature please let me us know as we're keen to improve it.

You would replace this with the item ID or note ID. For example, for the endpoint DELETE /tags/:id/notes/:note_id, to remove the tag with ID &quot;ABCD1234&quot; from the note with ID &quot;EFGH789&quot;, you would run for example: curl -X DELETE http://localhost:41184/tags/ABCD1234/notes/EFGH789  The four verbs supported by the API are the following ones: GET: To retrieve items (notes, notebooks, etc.).POST: To create new items. In general most item properties are optional. If you omit any, a default value will be used.PUT: To update an item. Note in a REST API, traditionally PUT is used to completely replace an item, however in this API it will only replace the properties that are provided. For example if you PUT {&quot;title&quot;: &quot;my new title&quot;}, only the &quot;title&quot; property will be changed.

You can specify the number of items to be returned using the limit parameter (the maximum being 100 items). The following call for example will initiate a request to fetch all the notes, 10 at a time, and sorted by &quot;updated_time&quot; ascending: curl http://localhost:41184/notes?order_by=updated_time&amp;order_dir=ASC&amp;limit=10  This will return a result like this { &quot;items&quot;: [ /* 10 notes */ ], &quot;has_more&quot;: true }  Then you will resume fetching the results using this query: curl http://localhost:41184/notes?order_by=updated_time&amp;order_dir=ASC&amp;limit=10&amp;page=2  Eventually you will get some results that do not contain an &quot;has_more&quot; parameter, at which point you will have retrieved all the results As an example the pseudo-code below could be used to fetch all the notes:  async function fetchJson(url) { return (await fetch(url)).json(); } async function fetchAllNotes() { let pageNum = 1; do { const response = await fetchJson((http://localhost:41184/notes?page=' + pageNum++); console.info('Printing notes:', response.items); } while (response.has_more) }  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Error handling​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Joplin Data API","url":"/fr/help/api/references/rest_api#error-handling","content":"In case of an error, an HTTP status code &gt;= 400 will be returned along with a JSON object that provides more info about the error.

But on first use, there are a couple things to do to make the most of Joplin. If you had been using another note-taking application and want to migrate those notes into Joplin, then you must first export them from your previous application and import into Joplin (see Importing and Exporting). So now you have a collection of notes on one computer or device; that is, all your notes are stored locally, not &quot;in the cloud&quot;. In order to share your notes among multiple devices, then, you need to synchronise the first device with some cloud provider (see Synchronisation for the supported cloud providers). This will upload all your notes to the cloud. You can then install Joplin on any number of other devices, synchronise to the same provider, and then all your notes will be downloaded on each device. After all that synchronisation is done the first time, then moving forward whenever you edit a note on one device it will automatically sync with all your other devices within a few minutes. Important: Make sure all your data has been uploaded from the initial machine via synchronisation before setting up synchronisation on any additional machines. Otherwise initially you will not see all your data. So monitor your synchronisation progress in the sidebar (on the left) until it shows complete; only then should you start synchronisation on other machines.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Fichiers joints","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/fr/help/apps/attachments","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Downloading attachments​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Fichiers joints","url":"/fr/help/apps/attachments#downloading-attachments","content":"La façon dont les pièces jointes sont téléchargées lors de la synchronisation peut être personnalisée dans l'écran de configuration , dans &quot;Comportement de téléchargement des pièces jointes&quot;.

The function below, which you can copy anywhere in your file, will use this method and return an array of headers, with the text and level (H1, H2, etc.) of header: function noteHeaders(noteBody:string) { const headers = []; const lines = noteBody.split('\\n'); for (const line of lines) { const match = line.match(/^(#+)\\s(.*)*/); if (!match) continue; headers.push({ level: match[1].length, text: match[2], }); } return headers; }  Then call this function from your event handler: joplin.plugins.register({ onStart: async function() { async function updateTocView() { const note = await joplin.workspace.selectedNote(); if (note) { const headers = noteHeaders(note.body); console.info('The note has the following headers', headers); } else { console.info('No note is selected'); } } // ... }, });  Later you will also need a way to generate the slug for each header. A slug is an identifier which is used to link to a particular header. Essentially a header text like &quot;My Header&quot; is converted to &quot;my-header&quot;. And if there's already a slug with that name, a number is appended to it. Without going into too much details, you will need the &quot;slug&quot; package to generate this for you, so install it using npm i -s 'git+https://github.com/laurent22/uslug.git#emoji-support' from the root of your plugin directory (Note: you can also install the &quot;uslug&quot; package on its own, but it won't have emoji support). Then this is the function you will need for Joplin, so copy it somewhere in your file: const uslug = require('@joplin/fork-uslug'); let slugs = {}; function headerSlug(headerText) { const s = uslug(headerText); let num = slugs[s] ? slugs[s] : 1; const output = [s]; if (num &gt; 1) output.push(num); slugs[s] = num + 1; return output.join('-'); }  And you will need a utility function to escape HTML. There are many packages to do this but for now you can simply use this: // From https://stackoverflow.com/a/6234804/561309 function escapeHtml(unsafe:string) { return unsafe .replace(/&amp;/g, &quot;&amp;amp;&quot;) .replace(/&lt;/g, &quot;&amp;lt;&quot;) .replace(/&gt;/g, &quot;&amp;gt;&quot;) .replace(/&quot;/g, &quot;&amp;quot;&quot;) .replace(/'/g, &quot;&amp;#039;&quot;); }  Again try to run the plugin and if you select a note with multiple headers, you should see the header list in the console.

Panels are a simple way to add custom content to the UI using HTML/CSS and JavaScript. First you would create the panel object and get back a view handler. Using this handler, you can set various properties such as the HTML content. Here's how it could be done: joplin.plugins.register({ onStart: async function() { // Create the panel object const panel = await joplin.views.panels.create('panel_1'); // Set some initial content while the TOC is being created await joplin.views.panels.setHtml(panel, 'Loading...'); async function updateTocView() { const note = await joplin.workspace.selectedNote(); slugs = {}; // Reset the slugs if (note) { const headers = noteHeaders(note.body); // First create the HTML for each header: const itemHtml = []; for (const header of headers) { const slug = headerSlug(header.text); // - We indent each header based on header.level. // // - The slug will be needed later on once we implement clicking on a header. // We assign it to a &quot;data&quot; attribute, which can then be easily retrieved from JavaScript // // - Also make sure you escape the text before inserting it in the HTML to avoid XSS attacks // and rendering issues. For this use the `escapeHtml()` function you've added earlier. itemHtml.push(` &lt;p class=&quot;toc-item&quot; style=&quot;padding-left:${(header.level - 1) * 15}px&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;toc-item-link&quot; href=&quot;#&quot; data-slug=&quot;${escapeHtml(slug)}&quot;&gt; ${escapeHtml(header.text)} &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; `); } // Finally, insert all the headers in a container and set the webview HTML: await joplin.views.panels.setHtml(panel, ` &lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt; ${itemHtml.join('\\n')} &lt;/div&gt; `); } else { await joplin.views.panels.setHtml(panel, 'Please select a note to view the table of content'); } } // ... }, });  Now run the plugin again and you should see the TOC dynamically updating as you change notes.

To do so, first add a webview.css file next to index.ts, then you will need to let Joplin know about this file. This is done using the addScript() function (which is also used to add JavaScript files as we'll see later), like so: const panel = await joplin.views.panels.create('panel_1'); // Add the CSS file to the view, right after it has been created: await joplin.views.panels.addScript(panel, './webview.css');  This file is just a plain CSS file you can use to style your view. Additionally, you can access from there a number of theme variables, which you can use to better integrate the view to the UI. For example, using these variables you can use a dark background in dark mode, and a light one in light mode. The CSS file below would give the view the correct font color and family, and the right background colour: /* In webview.css */ .container { background-color: var(--joplin-background-color); color: var(--joplin-color); font-size: var(--joplin-font-size); font-family: var(--joplin-font-family); } .toc-item a { color: var(--joplin-color); text-decoration: none; }  Try the plugin and the styling should be improved.

This can be done using an external JavaScript file that will handle the click events. As for the CSS file, create a webview.js file next to index.ts, then add the script to the webview: // In index.ts const panel = await joplin.views.panels.create('panel_1'); await joplin.views.panels.addScript(panel, './webview.css'); await joplin.views.panels.addScript(panel, './webview.js'); // Add the JS file  To check that everything's working, let's create a simple event handler that display the header slug when clicked: // In webview.js // There are many ways to listen to click events, you can even use // something like jQuery or React.

You can however send messages to and from the webview to the plugin, and you can call the Joplin API from the plugin. From within a webview, you have access to the webviewApi object, which among others has a postMessage() function you can use to send a message to the plugin. Let's use this to post the slug info to the plugin: Change webview.js like so: document.addEventListener('click', event =&gt; { const element = event.target; if (element.className === 'toc-item-link') { // Post the message and slug info back to the plugin: webviewApi.postMessage({ name: 'scrollToHash', hash: element.dataset.slug, }); } });  Then from the plugin, in src/index.ts, you can listen to this message using the onMessage() handler. Then from this handler, you can call the scrollToHash command and pass it the slug (or hash). joplin.plugins.register({ onStart: async function() { const panel = await joplin.views.panels.create('panel_1'); // ... await joplin.views.panels.onMessage(panel, (message) =&gt; { if (message.name === 'scrollToHash') { // As the name says, the scrollToHash command makes the note scroll // to the provided hash. joplin.commands.execute('scrollToHash', message.hash) } }); // ... } // ...  And that's it! If you run this code you should now have a fully functional TOC. The full source code is available there: https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/tree/dev/packages/app-cli/tests/support/plugins/toc/ Various improvements can be made such as improving the styling, making the header collapsible, etc. but that tutorial should provide the basic building blocks to do so. You might also want to check the plugin API for further information or head to the development forum for support.

To fix this, run npm install --save-dev @codemirror/view in the plugin's base directory: $ cd path/to/codemirror6-plugin/ $ npm install --save-dev @codemirror/view  remarque The default webpack.config.js tells Webpack not to bundle several packages, including @codemirror/view. As such, the @codemirror/view plugin is used only for type information. This is what we want. If @codemirror/view is bundled with the plugin, it could conflict with the version of @codemirror/view used by Joplin. In general, CodeMirror packages can break if multiple copies of the same package try to use the same editor. This is also why a newer version of webpack.config.js is required to build the plugin.

En termes de données, les deux seules choses qui pourraient légèrement différer sont: Données de reconnaissance - Les images d'Evernote, en particulier les documents numérisés (ou photographiés) ont données de reconnaissance associées à eux. C'est le texte que Evernote a pu reconnaître dans le document. Ces données ne sont pas conservées lorsque la note est importée dans Joplin. However, if you have enabled OCR in Joplin, that recognition data will be recreated in a format compatible with Joplin.Couleur, taille de police et visages - Le texte Evernote est stocké en HTML et est converti en Markdown pendant le processus d'importation. Pour les notes qui sont pour la plupart en texte brut ou avec la mise en forme de base (gras, italique, points de puces, liens, etc.). il s'agit d'une conversion sans perte, et la note, une fois rendu en HTML devrait être très similaire. Les tables sont également importées et converties dans les tables Markdown. Pour les notes très complexes, certaines données de formatage peuvent être perdues - en particulier les couleurs, les tailles de police et les faces de police ne seront pas importées. Le texte lui-même est cependant toujours importé dans son intégralité, indépendamment du formatage. S'il est essentiel que ces données supplémentaires soient conservées, alors Joplin autorise également l'importation de fichiers ENEX en HTML.Links between notes are mostly preserved. However the ENEX format does not include all the necessary information to find out what the target of a link is (specifically, Evernote use an ID for the link but that ID is not associated with the target note). Instead Joplin tries to guess what note is linked based on the note title, which mostly works, but not always - for example if multiple notes have the same title, or if the link title is different from the target note title. If Joplin cannot guess how to restore the link, the Evernote link will remain. Pour importer des données Evernote, exportez d'abord vos cahiers Evernote vers des fichiers ENEX comme décrit à ici. Puis suivez ces étapes: Dans l'application de bureau, ouvrez Fichier &gt; Importer &gt; ENEX et sélectionnez votre fichier. Les notes seront importées dans un nouveau bloc-notes séparé. Si nécessaire, ils peuvent ensuite être déplacés vers un autre notebook, ou le notebook peut être renommé, etc. Dans l'application terminal, en mode ligne de commande, tapez import /path/to/file.enex. Cela importera les notes dans un nouveau bloc-notes nommé d'après le nom du fichier. In both cases you can either import a single file or a directory that contains multiple ENEX files. If you import a single file, a notebook with the same name will be created, and all notes will be imported in this notebook.If you import a directory, Joplin will create a notebook per file and import the notes into them.

En son cœur, Joplin stocke les notes au format Markdown. Markdown est un moyen simple de formater du texte qui a l'air beau sur n'importe quel appareil et, alors que le texte est formaté, il a l'air parfaitement lisible dans un éditeur de texte brut. Dans certains cas, cependant, le format de balisage supplémentaire qui apparaît dans les notes peut être considéré comme un inconvénient. Le texte gras ressemblera à **comme ceci** par exemple, et les tables pourraient ne pas être particulièrement lisibles. Pour cette raison, Joplin dispose également d'un éditeur de texte riche, qui vous permet de modifier des notes avec une expérience d'édition WYSIWYG. Le texte en gras &quot;ressemblera à comme ceet les tables seront plus lisibles, entre autres. Cependant il y a une capture: dans Joplin, notes, même s'ils sont édités avec cet éditeur de texte riche, sont encore Markdown sous le capot. C'est généralement une bonne chose, car cela signifie que vous pouvez à tout moment basculer entre Markdown et Rich Text editor, et la note est toujours lisible. Il est également bon de synchroniser avec l'application mobile, qui n'a pas d'éditeur de texte riche. La prise est que Markdown est utilisé sous le capot, cela signifie que l'éditeur de texte riche a un certain nombre de limitations qu'il hérite de ce format: Pour commencer, la plupart des plugins Markdown ne seront pas compatibles. Si vous ouvrez une note Markdown qui utilise ce plugin dans l'éditeur de texte riche, il est probable que vous perdrez le formatage spécial du plugin. Les seuls plugins supportés sont les plugins &quot;clôturés&quot; - ceux qui enveloppent une section de texte en triple ticks (par exemple, KaTeX, Mermaid, etc.). fonctionnent). Vous pouvez voir la compatibilité d'un plugin sur l'écran de configuration de Markdown.Les tables doivent avoir un en-tête, car il s'agit d'une exigence dans Markdown. Lorsque vous créez une table, elle vous permettra de la créer sans en-tête, mais sous le capot elle ajoutera une table vide. Et la prochaine fois que vous ouvrirez la note, cet en-tête vide sera présent.Tous les éléments d'une liste doivent être du même type, donc par exemple toutes les cases à cocher ou tous les points de puce. Si vous avez besoin de deux types différents, vous devez créer deux listes différentes séparées par une règle horizontale ou similaire.Les modes clavier spéciaux &quot;vim&quot; et &quot;emacs&quot; ne sont pas pris en charge.Si une note est de 'Markup - Markdown' et contient le formatage HTML, ceci peut être perdu lors de l'édition dans l'éditeur Rich Text car il ne peut pas être converti en Markdown. Les notes de 'Markup - HTML' ne sont pas affectées par les modifications dans l'éditeur de texte riche car cette conversion n'a pas lieu.Tous les liens de référence ([title][link-name]) sont convertis en liens en ligne ([title](https://example. om)) ) lorsque Joplin enregistre les changements depuis l'éditeur de texte riche. Ce sont les limitations connues, mais si vous remarquez un autre problème non répertorié ici, veuillez nous en informer sur le forum.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Synchronisation","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/fr/help/apps/sync/","content":"Synchronisation L'un des objectifs de Joplin est d'éviter d'être lié à une société ou un service en particulier, qu'il s'agisse d'Evernote, de Google ou de Microsoft. En tant que telle, la synchronisation est conçue sans aucune dépendance difficile à un service en particulier. La plupart du processus de synchronisation se fait à un niveau abstrait et l'accès aux services externes, comme Nextcloud ou Dropbox, se fait via des pilotes légers. Il est facile de supporter de nouveaux services en créant des pilotes simples qui fournissent une interface de type système de fichiers, i. . la possibilité de lire, écrire, supprimer et lister des éléments. Il est également simple de passer d'un service à un autre. Actuellement, la synchronisation est possible avec Joplin Cloud, Nextcloud, S3, WebDAV, Dropbox, OneDrive ou le système de fichiers local. Pour activer la synchronisation, veuillez suivre les instructions ci-dessous. Après cela, l'application se synchronisera en arrière-plan chaque fois qu'elle est en cours d'exécution, ou vous pouvez cliquer sur &quot;Synchroniser&quot; pour démarrer une synchronisation manuellement. Joplin se synchronisera automatiquement en arrière-plan après toute modification de contenu sur l'application locale. Si le client terminal **** a été installé, il est également possible de synchroniser en dehors de l'interface utilisateur en tapant joplin sync depuis le terminal. Ceci peut être utilisé pour configurer un script cron pour synchroniser à un intervalle régulier.

Il est recommandé de commencer avec l'application de bureau ou de terminal car ils fonctionnent généralement sur des appareils plus puissants (contrairement à l'application mobile), et pour qu'ils puissent chiffrer les données initiales plus rapidement. Pour l'activer, veuillez suivre ces étapes: Sur votre premier appareil (par exemple sur l'application de bureau), allez sur l'écran de configuration Chiffrement et cliquez sur &quot;Activer le chiffrement&quot;Entrez votre mot de passe. Ceci est le mot de passe de la clé maîtresse qui sera utilisé pour chiffrer toutes vos notes. Assurez-vous de ne pas l'oublier puisque, pour des raisons de sécurité, il ne peut pas être récupéré.Maintenant, vous devez synchroniser toutes vos notes pour qu'elles soient envoyées chiffrées à la cible de synchronisation (par exemple vers OneDrive, Nextcloud, etc.). Attendez toute synchronisation qui pourrait être en cours et cliquez sur &quot;Synchroniser&quot;.Attendez que cette opération de synchronisation soit terminée. Puisque toutes les données doivent être renvoyées (chiffrées) à la cible de synchronisation, cela peut prendre beaucoup de temps, surtout si vous avez beaucoup de notes et de ressources. Notez que même si la synchronisation semble bloquée, il est probablement toujours en cours d'exécution. Ne l'annulez pas et laissez-le simplement courir la nuit si nécessaire.Une fois cette première opération de synchronisation terminée, ouvrez le périphérique suivant avec lequel vous êtes en train de synchroniser. Cliquez sur &quot;Synchroniser&quot; et attendez que l'opération de synchronisation se termine. L'appareil recevra la clé maîtresse et vous devrez lui fournir le mot de passe. À ce stade, E2EE sera automatiquement activé sur cet appareil. Une fois terminé, cliquez sur Synchroniser à nouveau et attendez qu'il se termine.Répétez l'étape 5 pour chaque appareil. N'activez pas manuellement le chiffrement sur plusieurs périphériques en parallèle, mais attendez plutôt que les autres les synchronisent avec le premier périphérique déjà chiffré. Sinon, vous pourriez avoir plusieurs clés de chiffrement (qui sont supportées par Joplin, mais probablement pas ce que vous voulez). Une fois que tous les périphériques sont synchronisés avec E2EE activé, le chiffrement/décryptage doit être principalement transparent.

La plateforme est également bien prise en charge et avec une communauté forte, donc il est susceptible d'être présent pendant un certain temps - puisqu'il est de toute façon open source, ce n'est pas un service qui peut être fermé, il peut exister sur un serveur aussi longtemps que vous le souhaitez. Dans l'application de bureau ou **, aller à l'écran Configuration et sélectionner Nextcloud comme cible de synchronisation.

Do not simply add a text Implement feature #4345 or link to forum posts, because the information there will most likely be outdated or confusing (multiple discussions and opinions). The pull request needs to be self-contained.Bug fixes are always welcome. Start by reviewing the list of bugsA good way to easily start contributing is to pick and work on a good first issue. We try to make these issues as clear as possible and provide basic info on how the code should be changed, and if something is unclear feel free to ask for more information on the issue.Before adding a new feature, ask about it in the Github Issue Tracker or the Joplin Forum, or check if existing discussions exist to make sure the new functionality is desired.Changes that will consist of more than 50 lines of code should be discussed on the Joplin Forum, so that you don't spend too much time implementing something that might not be accepted.All the applications share the same backend (database, synchronisation, settings, models, business logic, etc.) so if you change something in the backend in one app, make sure it still works in the other apps. Usually it does, but keep this in mind.Pull requests that make many changes using an automated tool, like for spell fixing, styling, etc. will not be accepted. An exception would be if the changes have been discussed in the forum and someone has agreed to review and test the pull request.Pull requests that address multiple issues will most likely stall and eventually be closed. This is because we might be fine with one of the changes but not with others and untangling that kind of pull request is too much hassle both for maintainers and the person who submitted it. So most of the time someone gives up and the PR gets closed. So please keep the pull request focused on one issue.Do not mark your reviewer's comments as &quot;resolved&quot;. If you do that, the comments will be hidden and the reviewer will not know what are the pending issues in the pull request. Only the reviewer should resolve the comments.

We use Jest as a testing framework so you will need to be familiar with it or go through their documentation. Running the tests​ To run all the test units, run from the root: yarn test  Or you can go inside a package folder, and run the tests from there. For example to run all the library tests, go in packages/lib and run yarn test To run just one particular file: ## Run all the tests in markdownUtils.test.ts yarn test markdownUtils  To run only a particular test in a file: ## Run only the test described as &quot;should handle conflict&quot; ## inside markdownUtils.test.ts: yarn test markdownUtils --filter=&quot;should handle conflict&quot;  Adding a new test file​ To add a test, simply create a new file with an extension .test.ts in the same directory. For example if you are working on the file example.ts, create a file example.test.ts for the unit tests. If this file already exist, simply add your tests directly to it. Setting the testing environment​ Many utility functions are available under the package @joplin/lib/testing/test-utils. Have a look for example at Note.test.ts to see how to setup test units with database support and synchroniser support. Note that this is not needed for all tests - if you just have a simple functions to test you won't need that extra setup. Testing React Hooks​ To test React Hooks please use the package @testing-library/react-hooks. See useLayoutItemSizes.test.ts for an example. If it is not possible to add tests​ More often than not, it is actually possible to add tests - just go back to your code and see if it can be refactored and certain functionalities moved to simple functions (with no dependencies). Once you have a simple function, you can easily add unit tests for it. Additionally, if the unit tests are not sufficient, please provide a manual testing plan, which should include detailed steps on: How to test that your feature is working. Include at least 5 tests. Try to think of the possible inputs - if it's a list, how does it work with 0 elements, or 1, or 10, or 100,000. If it's a text input, how does it work with an empty string, or a very large string, etc. Basically don't just put one test that check the best case scenario.How to verify that related parts of the applications are not broken. For example if you changed the note loading logic, check that the toolbar is still working as expected (and not modifying the previously loaded note for example), check that switching from one note to another still works. Look at the note list and verify that the note title is updated there too, etc. A reviewer should be able to run the app with your changes, then do the above steps to verify that everything's working as expected.

En tant que telle, la synchronisation est conçue sans aucune dépendance difficile à un service en particulier. La plupart du processus de synchronisation se fait à un niveau abstrait et l'accès aux services externes, comme Nextcloud ou Dropbox, se fait via des pilotes légers. Il est facile de supporter de nouveaux services en créant des pilotes simples qui fournissent une interface de type système de fichiers, i. . la possibilité de lire, écrire, supprimer et lister des éléments. Il est également simple de passer d'un service à un autre. Actuellement, la synchronisation est possible avec Joplin Cloud, Nextcloud, S3, WebDAV, Dropbox, OneDrive ou le système de fichiers local. Pour activer la synchronisation, veuillez suivre les instructions ci-dessous. Après cela, l'application se synchronisera en arrière-plan chaque fois qu'elle est en cours d'exécution, ou vous pouvez cliquer sur &quot;Synchroniser&quot; pour démarrer une synchronisation manuellement. Joplin se synchronisera automatiquement en arrière-plan après toute modification de contenu sur l'application locale. Si le client terminal **** a été installé, il est également possible de synchroniser en dehors de l'interface utilisateur en tapant joplin sync depuis le terminal.

This is useful for companies, to collaborate on projects for example, but also for individual users when they want to share their notes with other people.

The main feature we would like to see is the ability to select a Nextcloud user from the app, then share a note with him or her. Once the note is shared, it will appear in the Joplin clients of the other user (via sync). The solution should be generic enough that it can later be used to share a whole notebook.

Write a clear proposal on what you plan to do, the scope of your project, and why we should choose you to do it. Proposals are the basis of the GSoC projects and therefore one of the most important things to do well. The proposal is not only the basis of our decision of which student to choose, it has also an effect on Google's decision as to how many student slots are assigned to Joplin. Below is the application template: Introduction Every software project should solve a problem. Before offering the solution (your Google Summer of Code project), you should first define the problem. What’s the current state of things? What’s the issue you wish to solve and why? Then you should conclude with a sentence or two about your solution. Include links to discussions, features, or bugs that describe the problem further if necessary. Project goals Be short and to the point, and perhaps format it as a list. Propose a clear list of deliverables, explaining exactly what you promise to do and what you do not plan to do. “Future developments” can be mentioned, but your promise for the Google Summer of Code term is what counts. Implementation Be detailed. Describe what you plan to do as a solution for the problem you defined above. Include technical details, showing that you understand the technology. Illustrate key technical elements of your proposed solution in reasonable detail. Include writing unit tests throughout the coding period, as well as code documentation. These critical elements cannot be left to the last few weeks of the program. If user documentation will be required, or apidox, etc. these should be written during each week, not at the end. Timeline Show that you understand the problem, have a solution, have also broken it down into manageable parts, and that you have a realistic plan on how to accomplish your goal. Here you set expectations, so don’t make promises you can’t keep. A modest, realistic and detailed timeline is better than promising the impossible. If you have other commitments during GSoC, such as a job, vacation, exams, internship, seminars, or papers to write, disclose them here. GSoC should be treated like a full-time job, and we will expect approximately 40 hours of work per week. If you have conflicts, explain how you will work around them. If you are found to have conflicts which you did not disclose, you may be failed. Open and clear communication is of utmost importance. Include your plans for communication in your proposal; daily if possible. You will need to initiate weekly formal communication such as a blog post on to be agreed placed. Lack of communication will result in you being failed. About me Provide your contact information (IRC nick, email, IM, phone) and write a few sentences about you and why you think you are the best for this job. Prior contributions to Joplin are required; list your commits. Name people (other developers, students, professors) who can act as a reference for you. Mention your field of study if necessary. Now is the time to join the relevant irc/telegram channels, mail lists and blog feeds. We want you to be a part of our community, not just contribute your code. Tell us if you are submitting proposals to other organizations, and whether or not you would choose Joplin if given the choice. Other things to think about: Are you comfortable working independently under a supervisor or mentor who is several thousand miles away, and perhaps 12 time zones away? How will you work with your mentor to track your work? Have you worked in this style before?If your native language is not English, are you comfortable working closely with a supervisor whose native language is English? What is your native language, as that may help us find a mentor who has the same native language?After you have written your proposal, you should get it reviewed. Do not rely on the Joplin mentors to do it for you via the web interface, although we will try to comment on every proposal. It is wise to ask a colleague or a developer to critique your proposal.

So, be sure you send your application and proof of enrolment before the final rush. Also, applications submitted very late will get the least attention from mentors, so you may get a lower vote because of that. Submitting a draft early will give time for feedback from prospective mentors. Keep it simple: Be concise and precise. Provide a clear, descriptive title. &quot;My Project&quot; is the worst possible title!

If you want to go that way, your proposal must be very easy readable to allow us to evaluate the changes of a project going through several coding programs. Aim wide: submit more than one proposal. You are allowed to submit to another organisation as well. If you do submit more than one proposal, tell us that and which proposal you would choose, if both were selected.

Write a clear proposal on what you plan to do, the scope of your project, and why we should choose you to do it.

The proposal is not only the basis of our decision of which student to choose, it has also an effect on Google's decision as to how many student slots are assigned to Joplin. Below is the application template: Introduction Every software project should solve a problem. Before offering the solution (your Google Summer of Code project), you should first define the problem. What’s the current state of things? What’s the issue you wish to solve and why? Then you should conclude with a sentence or two about your solution. Include links to discussions, features, or bugs that describe the problem further if necessary. Project goals Be short and to the point, and perhaps format it as a list. Propose a clear list of deliverables, explaining exactly what you promise to do and what you do not plan to do. “Future developments” can be mentioned, but your promise for the Google Summer of Code term is what counts. Implementation Be detailed. Describe what you plan to do as a solution for the problem you defined above. Include technical details, showing that you understand the technology. Illustrate key technical elements of your proposed solution in reasonable detail. Include writing unit tests throughout the coding period, as well as code documentation. These critical elements cannot be left to the last few weeks of the program. If user documentation will be required, or apidox, etc. these should be written during each week, not at the end.

If you have other commitments during GSoC, such as a job, vacation, exams, internship, seminars, or papers to write, disclose them here. GSoC should be treated like a full-time job, and we will expect approximately 40 hours of work per week. If you have conflicts, explain how you will work around them. If you are found to have conflicts which you did not disclose, you may be failed. Open and clear communication is of utmost importance. Include your plans for communication in your proposal; daily if possible. You will need to initiate weekly formal communication such as a blog post on to be agreed placed.

His HOWTO has some useful suggestions for anyone planning to mentor this year. You will subscribe to the relevant tags in the forum to discuss ideas. You will need to read the proposals as they come in, and vote on the proposals.

If you want to submit a pull request, please take into account the following rules: Pull requests must be based on an issue that existed before GSoC was started, or based on an issue created by a moderator.Each contributor may only create one pull request at a time. Once your pull request has been merged, you can post a second one. We have this rule in place due to our limited resources - if everyone was allowed to post multiple pull requests we will not be able to review them properly. It is also better for you because you only need to care about one PR - so spend time making sure it is as good as it can be - make sure it works well, has test units, documentation and screenshots (if relevant).If the pull request has serious issues, or would require a significant rewrite to be acceptable, we might closed it and you will not be allowed to open a new one. So please be careful when posting a PR.If you are borrowing code, please disclose it. It is fine and sometimes even recommended to borrow code, but we need to know about it to assess your work. If we find out that your pull request contains a lot of code copied from elsewhere, we will close the pull request.All pull request must have test units. If for some reason it is not possible to add tests, please let us know and explain why. In that case, you'll need to tell us what steps you followed to manually test your changes.No Work In Progress. ONLY completed and working pull requests, and with test units, will be accepted. A WIP would fall under rule 3 and be closed immediately.Please do not @mention contributors and mentor and do not ask for pull request reviews. Sometimes it takes time before we can review your pull request or answer your questions but we'll get to it sooner or later. @mentioning someone just adds to the pile of notifications we get and it won't make us look at your issue faster.Do not force push. If you make changes to your pull request, please simply add a new commit as that makes it easy for us to review your new changes. If you force push, we'll have to review everything from the beginning.

Mentoring takes time, and lots and lots of communication. Before subscribing yourself as a mentor, please make sure that the staff is aware of that. Ask them to send the Summer of Code Administrators an email confirming your involvement in the team. This is just a formality to make sure you are a real person we can trust; the administrators cannot know all active developers by their Google account ID. Then drop us a message in the forum. Prospective mentors should read the mentoring guide. Also, Federico Mena-Quintero has written some helpful information based on his experiences in previous years. His HOWTO has some useful suggestions for anyone planning to mentor this year. You will subscribe to the relevant tags in the forum to discuss ideas. You will need to read the proposals as they come in, and vote on the proposals. Daily communication is required with your contributor during the Community Bonding period, and multiple times per week during the coding period. Finally, know that we will never assign you to a project you do not want to work on. We will not assign you more projects than you can/want to take on either.

A good part of this project will be about researching how other projects organise their documentation, proposing a way that would work well for Joplin, and discussing your ideas with the mentors and users. You will need to be proactive and propose your own solution on how to structure the documentation - which sections and sub-sections should be created, how to split the existing README into smaller parts, etc. This is still a technical project though since you will need to deal with TypeScript, Markdown, HTML and CSS (and any other technology that might help) to build the new documentation.

If you want to submit a pull request, please take into account the following rules: In general please only work on issues that have been triaged - those are issues with labels such as &quot;high&quot;, &quot;medium&quot; or &quot;enhancement&quot;. It means an admin looked at it and added it to the backlog. Bug fixes are always welcome. Start by reviewing the list of bugs with high priority or medium priority.Alternatively you may look at the Good first issues.Also check the backlog of possible feature requests. Some of those are complex and not a good fit for a first pull request, but others are more simple so you might want to consider these.Finally you may implement a plugin in your own repository. Note that we will look at your code, so make sure your choose something not too trivial, so that you can really showcase your skills. Please announce your plugin on the forum, in the #plugins category. You may not work on issues created by yourself (or your friends). It is likely we will close such issues.Each contributor may only create one pull request at a time. Once your pull request has been merged, you can post a second one. We have this rule in place due to our limited resources - if everyone was allowed to post multiple pull requests we will not be able to review them properly. It is also better for you because you only need to care about one PR - so spend time making sure it is as good as it can be - make sure it works well, has test units, documentation and screenshots (if relevant).If the pull request has serious issues, or would require a significant rewrite to be acceptable, we might close it and you will not be allowed to open a new one. So please be careful when posting a PR.If you are borrowing code, please disclose it. It is fine and sometimes even recommended to borrow code, but we need to know about it to assess your work.All pull request must have test units. In some cases it might be almost impossible to add such tests (for example integration tests), but for anything else we insist on having them, and we may close the pull request if we see they could have been added but weren't. If you don't know how to add test units, please ask on the forum or Discord. If really it's not possible to add tests, we'll let you know at this point. Also please check again the Automated Tests documentation for more information.No Work In Progress. ONLY completed and working pull requests, and with test units, will be accepted. A WIP would fall under rule 3 and be closed immediately.Please do not @mention contributors and mentors and do not ask for pull request reviews. Sometimes it takes time before we can review your pull request or answer your questions but we'll get to it sooner or later. @mentioning someone just adds to the pile of notifications we get and it won't make us look at your issue faster.Do not force push. If you make changes to your pull request, please simply add a new commit as that makes it easy for us to review your new changes. If you force push, we'll have to review everything from the beginning.

Write a clear proposal on what you plan to do, the scope of your project, and why we should choose you to do it. Proposals are the basis of the GSoC projects and therefore one of the most important things to do well. The proposal is not only the basis of our decision of which contributor to choose, it has also an effect on Google's decision as to how many contributor slots are assigned to Joplin. Below is the application template: Introduction Every software project should solve a problem. Before offering the solution (your Google Summer of Code project), you should first define the problem. What’s the current state of things? What’s the issue you wish to solve and why? Then you should conclude with a sentence or two about your solution. Include links to discussions, features, or bugs that describe the problem further if necessary. Project goals Be short and to the point, and perhaps format it as a list. Propose a clear list of deliverables, explaining exactly what you promise to do and what you do not plan to do. “Future developments” can be mentioned, but your promise for the Google Summer of Code term is what counts. Implementation Be detailed. Describe what you plan to do as a solution for the problem you defined above. Include technical details, showing that you understand the technology. Illustrate key technical elements of your proposed solution in reasonable detail. Include writing unit tests throughout the coding period, as well as code documentation. These critical elements cannot be left to the last few weeks of the program. If user documentation will be required, or apidox, etc. these should be written during each week, not at the end. Timeline Show that you understand the problem, have a solution, have also broken it down into manageable parts, and that you have a realistic plan on how to accomplish your goal. Here you set expectations, so don’t make promises you can’t keep. A modest, realistic and detailed timeline is better than promising the impossible. If you have other commitments during GSoC, such as a job, vacation, exams, internship, seminars, or papers to write, disclose them here. GSoC should be treated like a full-time job, and we will expect approximately 40 hours of work per week. If you have conflicts, explain how you will work around them. If you are found to have conflicts which you did not disclose, you may be failed. Open and clear communication is of utmost importance. Include your plans for communication in your proposal; daily if possible. You will need to initiate weekly formal communication such as a blog post on to be agreed placed. Lack of communication will result in you being failed. About me Provide your contact information (IRC nick, email, IM, phone) and write a few sentences about you and why you think you are the best for this job. Prior contributions to Joplin are required; list your commits. Name people (other developers, students, professors) who can act as a reference for you. Mention your field of study if necessary. Now is the time to join the relevant irc/telegram channels, mail lists and blog feeds. We want you to be a part of our community, not just contribute your code. Tell us if you are submitting proposals to other organizations, and whether or not you would choose Joplin if given the choice. Other things to think about: Are you comfortable working independently under a supervisor or mentor who is several thousand miles away, and perhaps 12 time zones away? How will you work with your mentor to track your work? Have you worked in this style before?If your native language is not English, are you comfortable working closely with a supervisor whose native language is English? What is your native language, as that may help us find a mentor who has the same native language?After you have written your proposal, you should get it reviewed. Do not rely on the Joplin mentors to do it for you via the web interface, although we will try to comment on every proposal. It is wise to ask a colleague or a developer to critique your proposal.

The more people see your proposal, the more it will be discussed. Do not leave it all to the last minute: while it is Google that is operating the webserver, it would be wise to expect a last-minute overload on the server. So, be sure you send your application and proof of enrolment before the final rush. Also, applications submitted very late will get the least attention from mentors, so you may get a lower vote because of that. Submitting a draft early will give time for feedback from prospective mentors. Keep it simple: Be concise and precise. Provide a clear, descriptive title. &quot;My Project&quot; is the worst possible title! Know what you are talking about: Do not submit proposals that cannot be accomplished over a summer or that are not related to Joplin. If your idea is unusual, be sure to explain why you have chosen Joplin to be your mentoring organization.There could be exceptional reason to accept proposal what cannot be finished over the summer if either it is clearly recognisable that there will be commitment beyond the summer period or the project can be well separated in sub-project. If you want to go that way, your proposal must be very easy readable to allow us to evaluate the changes of a project going through several coding programs. Aim wide: submit more than one proposal. You are allowed to submit to another organisation as well. If you do submit more than one proposal, tell us that and which proposal you would choose, if both were selected.

If you want to submit a pull request, please take into account the following rules: In general please only work on issues that have been triaged - those are issues with labels such as &quot;high&quot;, &quot;medium&quot; or &quot;enhancement&quot;. It means an admin looked at it and added it to the backlog. Bug fixes are always welcome. Start by reviewing the list of bugs with high priority or medium priority.Alternatively you may look at the Good first issues.Also check the backlog of possible feature requests. Some of those are complex and not a good fit for a first pull request, but others are more simple so you might want to consider these.Finally you may implement a plugin in your own repository. Note that we will look at your code, so make sure your choose something not too trivial, so that you can really showcase your skills. Please announce your plugin on the forum, in the #plugins category. You may not work on issues created by yourself (or your friends). It is likely we will close such issues.Each contributor may only create one pull request at a time. Once your pull request has been merged, you can post a second one. We have this rule in place due to our limited resources - if everyone was allowed to post multiple pull requests we will not be able to review them properly. It is also better for you because you only need to care about one PR - so spend time making sure it is as good as it can be - make sure it works well, has test units, documentation and screenshots (if relevant).If the pull request has serious issues, or would require a significant rewrite to be acceptable, we might close it and you will not be allowed to open a new one. So please be careful when posting a PR.If you are borrowing code, please disclose it. It is fine and sometimes even recommended to borrow code, but we need to know about it to assess your work.All pull request must have test units. In some cases it might be almost impossible to add such tests (for example integration tests), but for anything else we insist on having them, and we may close the pull request if we see they could have been added but weren't. If you don't know how to add test units, please ask on the forum or Discord. If really it's not possible to add tests, we'll let you know at this point. Also please check again the Automated Tests documentation for more information.No Work In Progress. ONLY completed and working pull requests, and with test units, will be accepted. A WIP would fall under rule 3 and be closed immediately.Please do not @mention contributors and mentors and do not ask for pull request reviews. Sometimes it takes time before we can review your pull request or answer your questions but we'll get to it sooner or later. @mentioning someone just adds to the pile of notifications we get and it won't make us look at your issue faster.Do not force push. If you make changes to your pull request, please simply add a new commit as that makes it easy for us to review your new changes. If you force push, we'll have to review everything from the beginning. These rules we hope are fair to everyone, to contributors and maintainers, however if something is unclear or you have any question about them, please let us know!","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Google Summer of Code 2024","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/fr/help/dev/gsoc/gsoc2024/","content":"Google Summer of Code 2024 Joplin participates in GSoC 2024.

Write a clear proposal on what you plan to do, the scope of your project, and why we should choose you to do it. Proposals are the basis of the GSoC projects and therefore one of the most important things to do well. The proposal is not only the basis of our decision of which student to choose, it has also an effect on Google's decision as to how many student slots are assigned to Joplin. Below is the application template: Introduction Every software project should solve a problem. Before offering the solution (your Google Summer of Code project), you should first define the problem. What’s the current state of things? What’s the issue you wish to solve and why? Then you should conclude with a sentence or two about your solution. Include links to discussions, features, or bugs that describe the problem further if necessary. Project goals Be short and to the point, and perhaps format it as a list. Propose a clear list of deliverables, explaining exactly what you promise to do and what you do not plan to do. “Future developments” can be mentioned, but your promise for the Google Summer of Code term is what counts. Implementation Be detailed. Describe what you plan to do as a solution for the problem you defined above. Include technical details, showing that you understand the technology. Illustrate key technical elements of your proposed solution in reasonable detail. Include writing unit tests throughout the coding period, as well as code documentation. These critical elements cannot be left to the last few weeks of the program. If user documentation will be required, or apidox, etc. these should be written during each week, not at the end. Timeline Show that you understand the problem, have a solution, have also broken it down into manageable parts, and that you have a realistic plan on how to accomplish your goal. Here you set expectations, so don’t make promises you can’t keep. A modest, realistic and detailed timeline is better than promising the impossible. If you have other commitments during GSoC, such as a job, vacation, exams, internship, seminars, or papers to write, disclose them here. GSoC should be treated like a full-time job, and we will expect approximately 40 hours of work per week. If you have conflicts, explain how you will work around them. If you are found to have conflicts which you did not disclose, you may be failed. Open and clear communication is of utmost importance. Include your plans for communication in your proposal; daily if possible. You will need to initiate weekly formal communication such as a blog post on to be agreed placed. Lack of communication will result in you being failed. About me Provide your contact information (IRC nick, email, IM, phone) and write a few sentences about you and why you think you are the best for this job. Prior contributions to Joplin are required; list your commits. Name people (other developers, students, professors) who can act as a reference for you. Mention your field of study if necessary. Now is the time to join the relevant irc/telegram channels, mail lists and blog feeds. We want you to be a part of our community, not just contribute your code. Tell us if you are submitting proposals to other organizations, and whether or not you would choose Joplin if given the choice. Other things to think about: Are you comfortable working independently under a supervisor or mentor who is several thousand miles away, and perhaps 12 time zones away? How will you work with your mentor to track your work? Have you worked in this style before?If your native language is not English, are you comfortable working closely with a supervisor whose native language is English? What is your native language, as that may help us find a mentor who has the same native language?After you have written your proposal, you should get it reviewed. Do not rely on the Joplin mentors to do it for you via the web interface, although we will try to comment on every proposal. It is wise to ask a colleague or a developer to critique your proposal.

This prevents bleeding through nested components. For example, in the code below there are two components (order-form and slider-box), and each has one or more elements. &lt;form class=&quot;order-form&quot;&gt; &lt;input class=&quot;firstname&quot; type=&quot;text&quot;/&gt; &lt;input class=&quot;lastname&quot; type=&quot;text&quot;/&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;slider-box&quot;&gt; Select quantity: &lt;div class=&quot;knob&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/form&gt;  The components and their elements would be styled this way: .order-form &gt; firstname, .order-form &gt; lastname { padding: 10px; } .slider-box &gt; knob { border-width: 1px; }  What if you want to apply a style to slider-box when it is inside order-form? Do NOT do this: .order-form &gt; .slider-box { } /* WRONG */  slider-box is a component but also an element of order-form. So in that case, name the element, for example as quantityslider, then you can style it: &lt;div class=&quot;slider-box quantityslider&quot;&gt; Select quantity: &lt;div class=&quot;knob&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  .order-form &gt; .quantityslider { margin-left: 10px; }  The goal of this approach is to specifically target the elements that you need and nothing else.

Although all items have been re-uploaded to the target, their timestamps did not change (because the item data itself has not changed, only its representation). Because of this, client 2 will not re-download the items - it does not need to do so anyway since it has already the item data.When a client sync and download a master key for the first time, encryption will be automatically enabled (user will need to supply the master key password). In that case, all items that are not encrypted will be re-synced. Uploading only non-encrypted items is an optimisation since if an item is already encrypted locally it means it's encrypted on target too.If both clients are in sync with E2EE enabled: if client 1 disable E2EE, it's going to re-upload all the items unencrypted. Client 2 again will not re-download the items for the same reason as above (data did not change, only representation). Note that user must manually disable E2EE on all clients otherwise some will continue to upload encrypted items. Since synchronisation is stateless, clients do not know whether other clients use E2EE or not so this step has to be manual.Although messy, Joplin supports having some clients send encrypted items and others unencrypted ones. The situation gets resolved once all the clients have the same E2EE settings.Currently, there is no way to delete encryption keys if you do not need them anymore or if you disabled the encryption completely. You will get a persistent notification to provide a Master Key password on a new device, even if encryption is disabled.

The key is generated during sync because otherwise multiple clients could generate a PPK, and then there would be a conflict to decide which PPK should be kept.

Condition 2 saves the state has it was before the edit. The reason for that is that we save revisions every 10 minutes, but if you make many changes within a few minutes and then stop modifying the note, the final revision will not contain the current content of the note. Basically at one point (let's say at t1) the service will see there's a revision from less than 10 minutes, and will not save a new one. That's why when you change the note again more than 7 days later, we save that revision that wasn't saved at t1. The logic is a bit complicated but the goal is to preserve the last significant state of a note. If you make many changes to a note then stop editing it for several months, the last significant state was at the end of that series of edits, so we need to save that.

This is because clients build their data based on the Create/Update/Delete events so if we delete the CREATE events, certain notes will no longer be created on new clients. A possible solution would be to have this kind of logic client side: When a sync cursor is invalid, do a full sync, which will not rely on /delta but on the basicDelta() function as used for file system or webdav sync. It will simply compare what's on the server with what's on the client and do the sync like this. Once it's done, it can start using /delta again. Advantage if that it can be done using basicDelta(). Disadvantage is that it's not possible accurately enumerate the server content that way, since new items can be created or deleted during that basicDelta process. A possibly more reliable technique would be to delete all Create/Delete event pairs. Doing so won't affect new clients - which simply won't get any CREATE event, since the item has been deleted anyway. It will affect clients that did not sync for a long time because they won't be notified that an item has been deleted - but that's probably an acceptable side effect. The main trouble will be the shared notes and notebooks - we'd need to make sure that when we delete something from a user it doesn't incorrectly delete it from another user (I don't think it would, but that will need to be considered). 2021-01-01 Obsolete Keeping all change events permanently would represent a lot of data, however it might be necessary. Without it, it won't be possible for a client to know what file has been deleted and thus a client that has not synced for a long time will keep its files permanently. So most likely we'll always keep the change events. However, we could compress the old ones to just &quot;create&quot; and &quot;delete&quot; events. All &quot;update&quot; events are not needed. And for a file that has been deleted, we don't need to keep the &quot;create&quot; event. The client would then follow this logic: For &quot;create&quot; events: If the file is present locally, update it with the version from the server.If the file is not present, create it using the version from the server. For &quot;delete&quot; events: If the file is present, delete it.If it is not, skip the event (not an error). It might seem we could derive the &quot;create&quot; events simply by looking at the files in the directory - all files that are there would implicitly have a &quot;create&quot; event. The issue however is that it's not possible to reliably iterate over the files in a folder, because they might change in the meantime. The change events on the other hand provide an ID that can be used reliably to iterate over changes, and to resume at any time.

For example, let's say we define a command in the plugin: joplin.commands.register({ name: 'testCommand1', label: 'My Test Command 1', }, { onExecute: (args:any) =&gt; { alert('Testing plugin command 1'); }, });  The &quot;onExecute&quot; event handler needs to be called whenever, for example, a toolbar button associated with this command is clicked. The problem is that it is not possible to send a function via IPC (which can only transfer plain objects), so there has to be a translation layer in between. The way it is done in Joplin is like so: In the sandbox proxy, the event handlers are converted to string event IDs and the original event handler is stored in a map before being sent to host via IPC. So in the example above, the command would be converted to this plain object: { name: 'testCommand1', label: 'My Test Command 1', }, { onExecute: '___event_handler_123', }  Then, still in the sandbox proxy, we'll have a map called something like eventHandlers, which now will have this content: eventHandlers['___event_handler_123'] = (args:any) =&gt; { alert('Testing plugin command 1'); }  In the plugin runner (Host side), all the event IDs are converted to functions again, but instead of performing the action directly, it posts an IPC message back to the sandbox proxy using the provided event ID. So in the host, the command will now look like this: { name: 'testCommand1', label: 'My Test Command 1', }, { onExecute: (args:any) =&gt; { postMessage('pluginMessage', { eventId: '___event_handler_123', args: args }); }; }  At this point, any code in the Joplin application can call the onExecute function as normal without having to know about the IPC translation layer. When the function onExecute is eventually called, the IPC message is sent back to the sandbox proxy, which will decode it and execute it. So on the sandbox proxy, we'll have something like this: window.addEventListener('message', ((event) =&gt; { const eventId = getEventId(event); // Get back the event ID (implementation might be different) const eventArgs = getEventArgs(event); // Get back the args (implementation might be different) if (eventId) { // And call the event handler eventHandlers[eventId](...eventArgs); } }));  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"On Mobile​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Plugin system architecture","url":"/fr/help/dev/spec/plugins#on-mobile","content":"On mobile, not only is the main plugin script running in a separate process, but so are the note editor, renderer, and dialogs. To simplify communication between these processes, a RemoteMessenger class is introduced. RemoteMessenger is abstract and independent from how messages are sent. Each type of message channel should have a subclass of RemoteMessenger to handle communication over that channel type. For example, WebViewToRNMessenger handles communication with React Native from within a React Native WebView. Similarly, RNToWebViewMessenger handles communication with a React Native WebView from within React Native. The RemoteMessenger&lt;LocalInterface, RemoteInterface&gt; class​ The RemoteMessenger class simplifies communication over postMessage. Its job is to convert asynchronous method calls to messages, then send these messages to another RemoteMessenger that handles them. For example, if we have // Dialogs export interface MainProcessApi { onSubmit: ()=&gt; void; onDismiss: ()=&gt; void; onError: (message: string)=&gt; Promise&lt;void&gt;; } export interface WebViewApi { setCss: (css: string)=&gt; void; closeDialog: ()=&gt; Promise&lt;void&gt;; setButtons: (buttons: ButtonSpec[])=&gt; void; }  We might then create messengers like this: In the WebView: const webViewApiImpl: WebViewApi = { // ... some implementation here ... setCss: css =&gt; {} // ... }; // Different messageChannelIds allow us to have multiple messengers communicate over the same channel. // Different IDs prevent the wrong messenger from acting on a message. const messageChannelId = 'test-channel'; const messenger = new WebViewToRNMessenger&lt;WebViewApi, MainProcessApi&gt;(messageChannelId, webViewApiImpl);  In the main process: const mainProcessApiImpl: WebViewApi = { // ... some implementation here ... closeDialog: () =&gt; {} // ... }; const messageChannelId = 'test-channel'; const messenger = new WebViewToRNMessenger&lt;MainProcessApi, WebViewApi&gt;(messageChannelId, mainProcessApiImpl); // We can now use the messenger. // Messages are all asynchronous. await messenger.remoteApi.setCss('* { color: red; }');  To call messenger.remoteApi.setCss(...), we use a process similar to the following: First: Queue the method call and wait for both messengers to be ready.​ To avoid sending messages that won't be received (and waiting indefinitely for a response), RemoteMessenger buffers messages until it receives a RemoteReady event. When a messenger is ready, it sends a message with kind: RemoteReady. When a messenger receives a message with kind: RemoteReady, it replies with the same message type. Second: Send all queued messages​ After both messengers are ready, we wend all queued messages. In this case, that's the setCss message: { kind: MessageType.InvokeMethod, methodPath: ['setCss'], arguments: { serializable: ['* { color: red; }'], // If there were callbacks, we would assign them // IDs and send the IDs here. callbacks: [ null ], }, }  After handling the message, a result is returned also by postMessage, this time with the kind ReturnValueResponse: After receiving the response, the setCss call resolves. On mobile, we address the same problem in similar, but more generalized way. We define a RemoteMessenger class that handles postMessage communication. RemoteMessenger and callbacks​ Suppose we call a method in a way similar to the following: messenger.remoteApi.joplin.plugins.register({ onStart: async () =&gt; { console.log('testing'); }, test: 'test', });  We can't send callbacks over postMessage. As such, we assign the onStart callback an ID and send the ID instead. The message might look like this: { kind: MessageType.InvokeMethod, methodPath: ['joplin', 'plugins', 'register'], arguments: { serializable: [ { onStart: null, test: 'test', } ], callbacks: [ { onStart: 'some-generated-id-for-onStart', test: null, } ], }, respondWithId: 'another-autogenerated-id', }  Note: As before, the respondWithId connects a method call to its return value (the return value has the same ID). The arguments.callbacks object contains only callback IDs and the arguments.serializable object contains only the serialisable arguments. The two objects otherwise should have the same structure. These two objects are merged by the RemoteMessenger that receives the message: Callbacks are called by sending an InvokeMethod message similar to the following: { kind: MessageType.InvokeMethod, methodPath: ['__callbacks', 'callback-id-here'], arguments: { ... }, respondWithId: 'some-autogenerated-id-here', }  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Joplin Server user status","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/fr/help/dev/spec/server_user_status","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"User flags​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Joplin Server user status","url":"/fr/help/dev/spec/server_user_status#user-flags","content":"User flags are used to indicate problem conditions with a particular account.

This is essentially an invitation that the sharer sent to recipients. There can be multiple such objects, and they can be accepted or rejected by the recipient. The process to share is then: First, the sharer calls POST /api/shares with the notebook ID that needs to be shared.Then invitations can be sent by calling POST /api/share_users and providing the share ID and recipient email.The recipient accept or reject the application by setting the status on the share_users object (which corresponds to an invitation). Once share is setup, the client recursively goes through all notes, sub-notebooks and resources within the shared notebook, and set their share_id property. Basically any item within the notebook should have this property set. Then all these items are synchronized. On the server, a service is running at regular interval to check the share_id property, and generate user_item objects for each recipient. Once these objects have been created, the recipient will start receiving the shared notebooks and notes.

Whenever a notes is moved out a shared folder, or whenever a resources is attached, the changes are tracked, and that can be used to easily assign a share_id property.

First, underlying Markdown Editor is explained. Editor is implemented using CodeMirror, and it provides the translation capability between line numbers of Markdown text and their pixel positions in Editor. A Markdown text being edited in Editor is converted to an HTML text using MarkdownIt, and it is rendered by Viewer, which is implemented using Electron's iframe. Editor and Viewer run in different processes, so an HTML text is sent through inter-process communication (ipc). Viewer has the rendered HTML as a DOM and provides the translation capability between DOM elements and their pixel positions in Viewer. New additions for Sync Scroll are shown in the figure as red portions. Since a DOM don't know the mapping between lines and elements, mapping information is embedded into an HTML tag as an additional attribute source-line using MarkdownIt. By using the attributes, the translation capability between line numbers and their pixel positions in Viewer can be provided.

For the translation function L2V(), information acquired from HTML DOM which is cached in scrollmap is used. To estimate precise positions between lines/elements, linear interpolation algorithm is used as shown in the figure.

To keep scrolling as light as possible, the information required for the translation is packed into a translation map named scrollmap and is cached for further reuses until outdated. Since scrollmap is already sorted, the binary search algorithm can be employed for querying lines or positions. It's faster than the linear search, and a query needed for one scrolling event/action is very light. For correct operation, the map should be discarded, when it becomes outdated, such as when a note is switched, when a note is edited, and when the window is resized. Simultaneously, the frequency of recreations should be minimal for users' comfort.

They expose some metadata such as name, description, what options they support, etc. Some may also implement a function to test whether the configuration is working (used from the configuration screen). Finally, the main role of this class is to initialise an instance of a FileApi.packages/lib/file-api-driver-*.ts: Those are the file APIs. They must implement generic file-like operations to create, update, delete or list files. This API is in turn used by the synchroniser to created, update or delete items.packages/lib/*Api.ts: The file-api-driver will call some low-level API to perform its operations. For example file-api-driver-local will use the fs package to read/write files, file-api-driver-amazon-s3 will use the AWS API to work with S3. In some cases however such a low-level API is not available - in that case, we usually create an *Api.ts file, which is used by the file API driver to perform its operations. For example, there is a JoplinServerApi.ts, which is used to connect to Joplin Server.In general, each object in the database is represented by a BaseModel class. Then each object than can be synced is represented by a BaseItem class that inherits from BaseModel. This class is where many sync-related utilities can be found such as itemsThatNeedSync() or methods that encrypt items so that they can be uploaded when E2EE is enabled.The state of each item is saved to the sync_items table. There is saved in particular the sync_time property which tells when the item was last synced. It is then used to decide what needs to be synced or not. Additional sync-related properties include sync_disabled, which is used in the rare case an item cannot be synced at all - for example if blocked by Dropbox for being &quot;restricted content&quot; (copyrighted), or is over the limit on Joplin Cloud.
