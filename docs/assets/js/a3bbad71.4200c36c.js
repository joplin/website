To specify on which port it should\n    run, set the api.port config variable. Commands are (start|stop|status).\n    This is an experimental feature - use at your own risks! It is recommended\n    that the server runs off its own separate profile so that no two CLI\n    instances access that profile at the same time. Use --profile to specify\n    the profile path.\n\nset <note> <name> [value]\n\n    Sets the property <name> of the given <note> to the given [value].\n    Possible properties are:\n\n    parent_id (text), title (text), body (text), created_time (int),\n    updated_time (int), is_conflict (int), latitude (numeric), longitude\n    (numeric), altitude (numeric), author (text), source_url (text), is_todo\n    (int), todo_due (int), todo_completed (int), source (text),\n    source_application (text), application_data (text), order (numeric),\n    user_created_time (int), user_updated_time (int), encryption_cipher_text\n    (text), encryption_applied (int), markup_language (int), is_shared (int),\n    share_id (text), conflict_original_id (text), master_key_id (text)\n\nstatus\n\n    Displays summary about the notes and notebooks.\n\nsync\n\n    Synchronises with remote storage.\n\n    --target <target>   Sync to provided target (defaults to sync.target\n                        config value)\n    --upgrade           Upgrade the sync target to the latest version.\n    --use-lock <value>  Disable local locks that prevent multiple clients from\n                        synchronizing at the same time (Default = 1)\n\ntag <tag-command> [tag] [note]\n\n    <tag-command> can be "add", "remove", "list", or "notetags" to assign or\n    remove [tag] from [note], to list notes associated with [tag], or to list\n    tags associated with [note]. The command `tag list` can be used to list\n    all the tags (use -l for long option).\n\n    -l, --long  Use long list format. Format is ID, NOTE_COUNT (for notebook),\n                DATE, TODO_CHECKED (for to-dos), TITLE\n\ntodo <todo-command> <note-pattern>\n\n    <todo-command> can either be "toggle" or "clear". Use "toggle" to toggle\n    the given to-do between completed and uncompleted state (If the target is\n    a regular note it will be converted to a to-do). Use "clear" to convert\n    the to-do back to a regular note.\n\nundone <note>\n\n    Marks a to-do as non-completed.\n\nuse <notebook>\n\n    Switches to [notebook] - all further operations will happen within this\n    notebook.\n\nversion\n\n    Displays version information\n')),(0,a.kt)("h2",{id:"license"},"License"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"Copyright (c) 2016-2023 Laurent Cozic"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,'Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:'),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,'THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
