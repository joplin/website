From this version you can enable OCR in the Configuration screen under the \\"General\\" section. Once activated, Joplin scans images and PDFs, extracting text data for searchability.\\n\\nWhile OCR search is available on both desktop and mobile apps, document scanning is limited to the desktop due to resource demands. For more information head to the [OCR official documentation](https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/ocr)!\\n\\n## Bundled plugins\\n\\nJoplin will now bundle high quality plugins that we feel will benefit most users. With this version we include the great [Backup plugin](https://github.com/JackGruber/joplin-plugin-backup) by JackGruber. This will provide another layer of safety when using Joplin as by default it will automatically backup your notes in a \\"JoplinBackup\\" folder in your home directory.\\n\\nNote that, just like any other plugin, you can change the plugin configuration or even disable it from the settings.\\n\\n## ENEX importer\\n\\nAs usual in recent version, there are plenty of improvements to the [Joplin ENEX importer](https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/import_export#importing-from-evernote). Besides the various fixes and enhancement to support this format, we\'ve added a few useful features:\\n\\n### Restore note links after importing an ENEX file\\n\\nEvernote Export files do not include the necessary information to reliably restore the links between notes, so for a long time this feature was not supported by the importer.\\n\\nNow however Joplin will try to guess what note is linked to what other note based on the note title, which in many cases will give the expected result. But not always - when that happens, and Joplin cannot detect the link target, the application leaves the original Evernote link. That way you can manually restore it yourself or at least find back what the note was linked to.\\n\\n### Import a directory of ENEX files\\n\\nIt is notoriously difficult to export data from Evernote because, among other issues, you can only export one notebook at a time, which is an obvious problems when you have dozens of notebooks. Unfortunately we cannot improve this part of the process since this up to Evernote, however we now make it easier to import all these notebook files by adding support for importing a folder of ENEX files. To use this feature, go to File &gt; Import, and select one of the \\"ENEX (Directory)\\" options.\\n\\nThis will process all the ENEX files in that directory and create a notebook in Joplin for each of them.\\n\\n## Beta Markdown editor\\n\\nThis version features further improvements to the new Markdown editor based on [CodeMirror 6](https://codemirror.net/). The goal eventually is to be able to use the same editor on both the desktop and mobile application (which already uses CodeMirror 6), which will allow a more consistent user experience across devices.\\n\\nPlugin support has also been improved in this version - plugin authors can now write native CodeMirror 6 extensions using the plugin API. For more information check the documentation on [how to create a Markdown plugin](https://joplinapp.org/help/api/tutorials/cm6_plugin/)!\\n\\nAnother benefit of this new editor is that, in a future version, it will allow us to support plugins on the mobile application since a plugin written for the desktop app will work on mobile too. There are several other advantages that Henry [listed in this forum post](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/pre-release-v2-13-is-now-available-updated-18-11-2023/32697/12?u=laurent).\\n\\n## Rich text editor improvements\\n\\nWe continue making improvements to the Rich Text Editor (RTE) in particular to improve interoperability with other applications, such as LibreOffice, Office or web browsers, as well as better handling of copy and paste.\\n\\nAnother notable addition is support for setting colours, which was a frequently asked feature. To use the feature, select it from the \\"...\\" button in the toolbar. Note that once applied the colours will work in the Markdown editor too!\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20240301-rte-colors.png)\\n\\nSee below for the full list of RTE changes:\\n\\n- Fixed: Rich text editor: Fix context menu not shown in some cases\\n- Improved: Speed up pasting text and images in Rich Text Editor\\n- Fixed: Fix drag-and-drop of images and text in the rich text editor\\n- Fixed: Fix images with SVG data URLs corrupted in the rich text editor\\n- Fixed: Pasting rich text in the RTE sometimes result in invalid markup\\n- Fixed: Rich text editor: Fix newline behavior in new notes\\n- Improved: Add support for changing text colors in rich text editor\\n- Fixed: Fix HTML resource links lost when editing notes in the rich text editor\\n- Fixed: Fix code blocks with blank lines break tables in the rich text editor\\n- Fixed: Copied and pasted text from Firefox to RTE does not include images\\n- Fixed: Pasting rich text in the RTE sometimes result in invalid markup\\n- Fixed: Fixed copying and pasting an image from Chrome in RTE\\n\\n# Full changelog\\n\\nThis is just an overview of the main features.

One notable improvement is the ability to seamlessly embed various content within tables, including lists and other tables, which was a frequently requested feature:\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20231203-rte-table.png)\\n\\nThe interoperability with other text editors such as Word and Excel has also been improved, in particular when copying and pasting content between these tools and Joplin.\\n\\n### Improved ENEX import\\n\\nThe Evernote Export format, known as ENEX, has always been challenging to support. This is because Evernote frequently changes it, breaking importers, and may also occasionally introduce bugs. At times, their own application struggles to import back files that it has exported, highlighting the volatility of the ENEX format.\\n\\nAfter undergoing continuous improvements for seven years, the importer has achieved a relatively stable state. The majority of issues encountered now stem from invalid files generated by Evernote, a result of bugs introduced in recent versions. Despite these challenges, we strive to enhance the import process by employing various heuristics to process the invalid data as effectively as possible.\\n\\nThe list of bug fixes is below:\\n\\n- Apply correct size to images imported from ENEX files\\n- ENEX files that contain resources with invalid mime types are imported correctly\\n- Ensure that ENEX resources with invalid filenames are imported correctly\\n- Prevent application from being stuck when importing an invalid ENEX file\\n\\n### New plugins APIs\\n\\n#### Note list\\n\\nWe are continuously improving the plugin API to make it as easy as possible to customize the application.\\n\\nOne of the main addition is support note list plugins - it allows any plugins to customise what the list should display each note.\\n\\nSee the [Joplin Plugin Note List API](https://joplinapp.org/api/references/plugin_api/classes/joplinviewsnotelist.html) and the [Note List Demo](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/packages/app-cli/tests/support/plugins/note_list_renderer/src/index.ts) for more information.\\n\\nThe demo includes three examples of note lists: a fundamental \\"top to bottom\\" version, a sophisticated \\"left to right\\" variant that additionally displays a note thumbnail, and a demonstration of an interactive note list, allowing direct modification of the note title from the list.\\n\\nThis API was developed based on the feedback we got and we hope it will be useful. We remain open to further input from users and plugin developers regarding any potential missing features and areas for improvement!\\n\\n#### Imaging API\\n\\nThe imaging API was created to allow plugin developers to easily load and manipulate images. For now it is possible to load PNG and JPG files, and to resize and crop them.\\n\\n[https://joplinapp.org/api/references/plugin_api/classes/joplinimaging.html](https://joplinapp.org/api/references/plugin_api/classes/joplinimaging.html)\\n\\n#### And more\\n\\nA few more APIs have been added such as one to [open dialog to select a file or folder](https://joplinapp.org/api/references/plugin_api/classes/joplinviewsdialogs.html#showopendialog) and a way to [access the plugin settings from a renderer script](https://joplinapp.org/api/references/plugin_api/enums/contentscripttype.html#getting-the-settings-from-the-renderer).\\n\\n### New beta Markdown editor\\n\\nThis version also features a new Markdown editor based on [CodeMirror 6](https://codemirror.net/). This change means that we\'ll be able to use the same editor on both the desktop and mobile application (which already uses CodeMirror 6), which will allow a more consistent user experience across devices.\\n\\nAnother benefit is that, in a future version, it will allow us to support plugins on the mobile application. There are several other advantages that Henry [listed in this forum post](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/pre-release-v2-13-is-now-available-updated-18-11-2023/32697/12?u=laurent).\\n\\n## Mobile\\n\\n### Drawing option\\n\\nIn this new version, Henry integrated the js-draw editor to the mobile app. Js-draw is a powerful freehand drawing library which allows you to draw using a pen, touch screen or mouse.\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20231203-drawing.png)\\n\\nThe editor is integrated to the mobile application. On desktop application, you can use the same library and edit your drawings using the [Freehand Drawing plugin](https://github.com/personalizedrefrigerator/joplin-plugin-freehand-drawing). We will make this plugin available by default in a future desktop release.\\n\\n### Setting screen\\n\\nThe mobile version also features a redesigned configuration screen. It is now divided into multiple sections with clear titles, and you can also search for settings using the built-in search option.\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20231203-settings.png)\\n\\n# Full changelog\\n\\nThis is just an overview of the main features.

This includes the discussion of issues on GitHub, as well as the submission of pull requests and related discussions. The transparency of these processes allows for collaborative problem-solving and shared insights.\\n\\nHowever, there is one aspect that operates behind closed doors, and for good reason: addressing cybersecurity vulnerabilities. It is imperative that these issues remain undisclosed until they have been resolved. Once a solution is implemented, it is usually accompanied by discreet commits and a message in the changelog to signify the progress made.\\n\\nTypically, the process begins with an email from a security researcher. They provide valuable insights, such as a specially crafted note that triggers a bug, or an API call, along with an explanation of how the application\'s security can be circumvented. We examine the vulnerability, create a fix, and create automated test units to prevent any accidental reintroduction of the vulnerability in future code updates.

Additionally, we often apply the fix to previous versions of Joplin, depending on the severity of the vulnerability.\\n\\nThe contribution of security researchers in this regard is immeasurable. They employ their ingenuity to identify inventive methods of bypassing existing security measures and often discover subtle flaws in the code that might otherwise go unnoticed.\\n\\nWe would like to express our sincere gratitude to the security researchers who have assisted us throughout the years in identifying and rectifying security vulnerabilities!\\n\\n- [@Alise](https://github.com/a1ise)\\n- @hexodotsh\\n- [@ly1g3](https://github.com/ly1g3)\\n- [@maple3142](https://twitter.com/maple3142)\\n- Ademar Nowasky Junior\\n- [Benjamin Harris](mailto:ben@mayhem.sg)\\n- [Javier Olmedo](https://github.com/JavierOlmedo)\\n- [Jubair Rehman Yousafzai](https://twitter.com/newfolderj)\\n- lin@UCCU Hacker\\n- [personalizedrefrigerator](https://github.com/personalizedrefrigerator)\\n- [Phil Holbrook](https://twitter.com/fhlipZero)\\n- [RyotaK](https://ryotak.net/)\\n- [Yaniv Nizry](https://twitter.com/YNizry)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n[<icon icon=\\"fa-brands fa-discourse\\" size=\\"lg\\" /> Discuss on the forum](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/33283)"},{"id":"/20230508-release-2-10","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/20230508-release-2-10","editUrl":"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/tree/dev/readme/news/20230508-release-2-10.md","source":"@site/news/20230508-release-2-10.md","title":"What\'s new in Joplin 2.10","description":"Great news!

Joplin 2.10 is here and we\'ve made some amazing improvements and bug fixes, with a focus on the mobile app.\\n\\n## New design for \\"New note\\" and \\"New to-do\\" buttons\\n\\nWe\'re excited to announce that we\'ve made it even easier to create new notes and to-do lists with new designs for the \\"New note\\" and \\"New to-do\\" buttons.\\n\\nIf there is enough space, the button labels will be shown in full:\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20230508-new-note-1.png)\\n\\nWhile for those who prefer a more narrow note list, only the button icons will be shown:\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20230508-new-note-2.png)\\n\\nIt\'s a small improvement, but we\'re confident it will make the app even more intuitive for new users.\\n\\n## Fixes and improvements\\n\\nThis version includes 30 bug fixes and 16 general improvements. Let\'s dive into some of the highlights:\\n\\n- Self Not Found and Pedro have been working tirelessly on improving the pasting of plain text in the application, and we\'re happy to say that there is now a brand new \\"Paste as text\\" option in the Edit menu.\\n- For our amazing plugin developers out there, we have added a few new APIs and fixed a bug that was preventing certain plugins from starting. You can now get even more creative with your plugins!\\n- Tao Klerks, has been hard at work fixing and improving the custom sort order of the note list. No more notes in the wrong position when you drop them! Plus, custom sort order is now synchronised too.\\n- We\'ve also fixed a few bugs with our Web Clipper, including an issue where certain pages wouldn\'t import their images. A new Web Clipper has also been released, so you can clip to your heart\'s content!\\n\\nLast but not least, we have modernised both the desktop and mobile application modules, just [as we previously announced](https://joplinapp.org/news/20221115-renovate/). Although these changes may not be visible to you, they required a lot of work! But the result is that our applications are now more stable and secure, and it will be easier to maintain them in the long run. We\'re using a tool called [Renovate](https://www.mend.io/free-developer-tools/renovate/), which will automatically propose package updates that we will review. In total, we\'ve updated a whopping 633 packages so far!\\n\\n## Android app is available in the Play Store\\n\\nOur latest version, 2.10, is now back in the Play Store and ready for download! Although we had to skip 2.9 due to some of Google\'s requirements, we worked hard to ensure that our app complies with their standards, and we are excited to announce that we are back and better than ever! Our iOS version is also available, so you can continue to enjoy the app regardless of the platform you use.\\n\\n### Biometrics support\\n\\nTo make your experience even more secure, our Android and iOS apps now support biometric unlock! With just a quick scan of your fingerprint or Face ID, you can unlock your app in no time. To enable this beta feature, just head over to the settings and click on \\"Use biometrics to secure access to the app\\".\\n\\nWe\'ve tested this feature thoroughly during prerelease, and have already fixed all known issues. However we still consider it as a beta feature for now, so if you run into any issues please let us know.\\n\\n### Support for multiple profile\\n\\nWe\'re thrilled to announce that multiple profiles are now supported in our mobile app! To create a new profile, simply go to the Configuration screen and click on \\"Manage profiles\\" under the Tools section.\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20230508-biometrics-1.png)\\n\\nFrom there, you can easily add or remove profiles as needed.\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20230508-biometrics-2.png)\\n\\nOnce multiple profiles are setup, you will see a new option in the sidebar to quickly toggle from one profile to another:\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20230508-biometrics-3.png)\\n\\nOnce you\'ve set up multiple profiles, you can easily toggle between them using the new option in the sidebar. This feature is perfect for separating your personal and work notes into independent collections.\\n\\n### Support for realtime search\\n\\nOur mobile app now has an improved search function that performs text searches in real time! No more waiting for the search results to load, they\'ll appear instantly as you type.\\n\\n### Improved filesystem sync performance\\n\\nThanks to the hard work of jd1378, the sync no longer freezes during filesystem synchronisation. We know how frustrating that can be, and we\'re thrilled to have solved this issue. Getting filesystem sync to work on Android is never easy due to the restrictions put in place by Google, especially since they frequently change, but we\'re committed to delivering the best possible experience for our Android users.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n[<icon icon=\\"fa-brands fa-discourse\\" size=\\"lg\\" /> Discuss on the forum](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/30716)"},{"id":"/20230508-release-2-11","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/20230508-release-2-11","editUrl":"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/tree/dev/readme/news/20230508-release-2-11.md","source":"@site/news/20230508-release-2-11.md","title":"What\'s new in Joplin 2.11","description":"Desktop Add support for plugin user data Developers of plugins now have the ability to associate additional information with notes, notebooks, and tags.

This data is then synchronized across multiple devices. For instance, it is possible to envision attaching OCR data to an image or incorporating plugin-specific parameters to a note, which can subsequently be synchronized across all devices.\\n\\n### Improved end-to-end encryption\\n\\nEnd-to-end encryption (E2EE) plays a vital role in safeguarding your data privacy. Our aim is to make it effortlessly user-friendly, seamlessly integrated, and possibly enabled by default.\\n\\nTo achieve this objective, we have implemented several enhancements in this version. These improvements encompass more streamlined management of encryption keys and simplified setup processes for both new and existing devices utilising end-to-end encryption.\\n\\nMoreover, we have upgraded the encryption algorithm from AES-128 to AES-256, ensuring heightened security for your data in the long run.\\n\\n### Export a Mermaid graph\\n\\nThere is now a context menu on Mermaid graphs which you can use to export your graph as PNG, SVG, or by copying the vector data to the clipboard.\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20230711-mermaid-export.png)\\n\\n### Auto-detect language on startup\\n\\nA small but useful change - the application language is now automatically detected startup. Of course, if needed you can later change it in the configuration screen.\\n\\n## Android\\n\\nAs always most of these changes also apply to the mobile applications, such as the improved end-to-end encryption support, language auto-detection, and various bug fixes and improvements. But besides those, we also have several mobile-specific updates:\\n\\n### Support for offline voice typing\\n\\nThe Android mobile app now support offline voice typing - it means your voice recording does not need to be uploaded to Google or Samsung server - it all takes place on your device for added security. To make use of it, open any note, tap on the three dots menu, then \\"Voice typing\\".\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20230711-voice-typing-1.png)\\n\\nThe first time, the app will need to download the language files to your device:\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20230711-voice-typing-2.png)\\n\\nOnce they are there, simply record your message and it will appear in the note:\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20230711-voice-typing-3.png)\\n\\n### Create and move sub-notebooks\\n\\n@jcgurango implemented support for creating sub-notebooks, and moving notebooks around in the mobile app. To do so, long press on any notebook and press \\"Edit\\". You can now choose to move it under any other notebook using the provided dropdown list.\\n\\n## Full changelog\\n\\nThis is just an overview of the main features.

Notably, we\'ve introduced support for plugin toolbar icons. Additionally, we\'ve refined the editor\'s ability to manage text that\'s copied from applications like Word, Office, and LibreOffice, thereby enhancing cross-application compatibility. Among the minor yet impactful improvements, we\'ve fine-tuned the handling of newlines and paragraphs\u2014a highly requested feature. Another notable update is the improved automatic switching between light and dark modes.\\n\\nAltogether, this release encompasses around 12 significant changes for the Rich Text editor, and rest assured, there\'s more to come in the future!\\n\\n### Share permissions\\n\\nUsing Joplin Cloud Teams, you now have the ability to customize the read and write permissions for the notebooks you share. You have the option to grant other users permission to edit the notes or share them as read-only. This ensures that you can confidently share a notebook without worrying about unintentional modifications by your friends or colleagues.\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20230825-share-permissions.png)\\n\\n### Email to Note\\n\\nJoplin Cloud Pro and Teams also now include the Email to Note feature, allowing you to conveniently store your emails within Joplin Cloud. By simply forwarding your emails to your Joplin Cloud address, you can transform them into notes. The email\'s subject will serve as the note title, while the body of the email will be the note\'s content. These notes will be organized within a notebook named \\"Inbox.\\"\\n\\nMore information in the [Email to Note documentation](https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/email_to_note).\\n\\n### Choose to resize an image or not\\n\\nBy default, when you add a large image, Joplin will ask you if you would like to shrink it down or not. With this new release, you now have the option to always ask, to always resize, or to never resize the image, giving you more flexibility and reducing the number of prompts in the app.\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20230825-resize-note.png)\\n\\n### Rotating log\\n\\nUp until now, the logs could grow to become very large, and if you wanted to shrink them down you would have to manually delete them. With this new release, we now automatically handle logs by rotating them - once the log becomes large enough it is moved to an archive. And once the archive is older than a number of days, it is deleted.\\n\\n### Mobile\\n\\nLike the desktop app, the mobile apps benefits from the Share Permissions update, as well as the Email to Note feature for Joplin Cloud. There are also plenty of other improvements - all in all there\'s 23 bug fixes, enhancements and security fixes in this release.\\n\\n## Full changelog\\n\\nThis is just an overview of the main features.

It looks good and it\'s even interactive! (You can click to collapse/expand blocks of text) But unfortunately it doesn\'t scale to large workflows, like we have for Joplin - the log can freeze and it will take forever to search for something. Indeed searching is done in \\"real time\\"... which mostly means it will freeze for a minute or two for each letter you type in the search box. Not great.\\n\\nThankfully GitHub provides an alternative access: the raw logs. This is much better because they will open as plain text, without any styling or JS magic, which means you can use the browser native search and it will be fast.\\n\\nBut now the problem is that raw logs look like this:\\n\\n![Raw log without extension](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20230116-ga-raw-log.png)\\n\\nWhile it\'s not impossible to read, all colours that would display nicely in a terminal are gone and replaced by [ANSI codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code). You can find what you need in there but it\'s not particularly easy.\\n\\nThis is where the new **GitHub Action Raw Log Viewer** extension for Chrome can help. It will parse your raw log and convert the ANSI codes to proper colours. This results in a much more readable rendering:\\n\\n![Raw log with extension](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20230116-ga-raw-log-colored.png)\\n\\nThe extension is fast even for very large logs and it\'s of course easy to search for text since it simply works with your browser built-in search.\\n\\nThe extension is open source, with the code available here: [https://github.com/laurent22/github-actions-logs-extension](https://github.com/laurent22/github-actions-logs-extension)\\n\\nAnd to install it, follow this link:\\n\\n[![Download GitHub Action Raw Log Viewer extension](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20230116-extension-get-it-now.png)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-action-raw-log-vie/lgejlnoopmcdglhfjblaeldbcfnmjddf)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n[<icon icon=\\"fa-brands fa-discourse\\" size=\\"lg\\" /> Discuss on the forum](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/29139)"},{"id":"/20221221-agpl","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/20221221-agpl","editUrl":"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/tree/dev/readme/news/20221221-agpl.md","source":"@site/news/20221221-agpl.md","title":"Joplin is switching to the GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AG...","description":"As was discussed last year, Joplin is switching to the GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPL-3.0) for the desktop, mobile and CLI applications, as well as the web clipper.

This is the main reason we switch to this license. It allows us to continue releasing the project as open source while ensuring that those who benefit commercially (or not) from it share back their changes.\\n\\n## What is the GPL license?\\n\\nThe AGPL license is based on the GPL license. This is what tldr;Legal has to say about the GPL license:\\n\\n> You may copy, distribute and modify the software as long as you track changes/dates in source files. Any modifications to or software including (via compiler) GPL-licensed code must also be made available under the GPL along with build & install instructions. ([source](https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v3-(gpl-3)))\\n\\n## What is the AGPL license?\\n\\nThis is the license we\'ll use for Joplin from now on:\\n\\n> You may copy, distribute and modify the software as long as you track changes/dates in source files. Any modifications to or software including (via compiler) GPL-licensed code must also be made available under the GPL along with build & install instructions. ([source](https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v3-(gpl-3)))\\n> \\n> \\n> The AGPL license differs from the other GNU licenses in that it was built for network software. You can distribute modified versions if you keep track of the changes and the date you made them. As per usual with GNU licenses, you must license derivatives under AGPL. It provides the same restrictions and freedoms as the GPLv3 but with an additional clause which makes it so that source code must be distributed along with web publication. Since web sites and services are never distributed in the traditional sense, the AGPL is the GPL of the web. ([source](https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-affero-general-public-license-v3-(agpl-3.0)))\\n\\n## What does it change for users?\\n\\nThere is no changes for users of Joplin - the apps remain open sources and you can still use them freely.\\n\\n## What does it change for developers?\\n\\nAny code you develop for Joplin will also remain open source. The only difference is that we\'ll ask to sign an Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA) to ensure that the copyright of the entire codebase remains with the Joplin organisation. This is necessary so that if we ever want to change the license again we are able to do so without having to get the agreement of each individual contributor afterwards (which would be nearly impossible).\\n\\nThis is a bit of an extra constraint but it is hard to avoid. Contributor License Agreements are very common for GPL or AGPL projects. For example Apache, Canonical or Python all require their contributors to sign a CLA.\\n\\n## Questions?\\n\\nIf you have any questions please let us know. Overall we believe this is a positive improvements for Joplin as it means any work derives from it will also benefit the project.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n[<icon icon=\\"fa-brands fa-discourse\\" size=\\"lg\\" /> Discuss on the forum](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/28747)"},{"id":"/20221216-release-2-9","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/20221216-release-2-9","editUrl":"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/tree/dev/readme/news/20221216-release-2-9.md","source":"@site/news/20221216-release-2-9.md","title":"What\'s new in Joplin 2.9","description":"Proxy support Both the desktop and mobile application now support proxies thanks to the work of Jason Williams.

This will allow you to use the apps in particular when you are behind a company proxy.\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20221216-proxy-support.png)\\n\\n## New PDF viewer\\n\\nThe desktop application now features a new PDF viewer thanks to the work of Asrient during GSoC.\\n\\nThe main advantage for now is that this viewer preserves the last PDF page that was read. In the next version, the viewer will also include a way to annotate PDF files.\\n\\n## Multi-language spell checking\\n\\nThe desktop app include a multi-language spell checking features, which allows you, for example, to spell-check notes in your native language and in English.\\n\\n## New mobile text editor\\n\\nWriting formatted notes on mobile has always been cumbersome due to the need to enter special format characters like `*` or `[`, etc.\\n\\nThanks to the work of Henry Heino during GSoC, writing notes on the go is now easier thanks to an improved Markdown editor.\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20221216-mobile-beta-editor.png)\\n\\nThe most visible feature is the addition of a toolbar, which helps input those special characters, like on desktop.\\n\\nMoreover Henry made a lot of subtle but useful improvements to the editor, for example to improve the note appearance, to improve list continuation, etc. Search within a note is now also supported as well as spell-checking.\\n\\nAt a more technical level, Henry also added many test units to ensure that the editor remains robust and reliable.\\n\\nTo enable the feature, go to the configuration screen and selected \\"Opt-in to the editor beta\\". It is already very stable so we will probably promote it to be the main editor from the next version.\\n\\n## Improved alignment of notebook icons\\n\\nPreviously, when you would assign an icon to a notebook, it would shift the title to the right, but notebook without an icon would not. It means that notebooks with and without an icon would not be vertically aligned.\\n\\nTo tidy things up, this new version adds a default icons to notebooks without an explicitly assigned icon. This result in the notebook titles being correctly vertically aligned.\\n\\nNote that this feature is only enabled if you use custom icons - otherwise it will simply display the notebook titles without any default icons, as before.\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20221216-notebook-icons.png)\\n\\n## Improved handling of file attachments\\n\\nSelf Not Found made a number of small but useful improvements to attachment handling, including increasing the maximum size to 200MB, adding support for attaching multiple files, and fixing issues with synchronising attachments via proxy.\\n\\n## Fixed filesystem sync on mobile\\n\\nThis was a long and complex change due to the need to support new Android APIs but hopefully that should now be working again, thanks to the work of jd1378.\\n\\nSo you can now sync again your notes with Syncthing and other file-based synchronisation systems.\\n\\n## And more...\\n\\nIn total this new desktop version includes 36 improvements, bug fixes, and security fixes.\\n\\nAs always, a lot of work went into the Android and iOS app too, which include 37 improvements, bug fixes, and security fixes.\\n\\nSee here for the changelogs:\\n\\n- [Desktop app changelog](https://joplinapp.org/help/about/changelog/desktop)\\n- [Android app changelog](https://joplinapp.org/help/about/changelog/android/)\\n\\n## About the Android version\\n\\nUnfortunately we cannot publish the Android version because it is based on a framework version that Google does not accept. To upgrade the app a lot of changes are needed and another round of pre-releases, and therefore there will not be a 2.9 version for Google Play. You may however download the official APK directly from there: [Android 2.9 Official Release](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin-android/releases/tag/android-v2.9.8)\\n\\nThis is the reality of app stores in general - small developers being imposed never ending new requirements by all-powerful companies, and by the time a version is finally ready we can\'t even publish it because yet more requirements are in place.\\n\\nFor the record the current 2.9 app works perfectly fine. It targets Android 11, which is only 2 years old and is still supported (and installed on millions of phones). Google requires us to target Android 12 which only came out last year.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n[<icon icon=\\"fa-brands fa-discourse\\" size=\\"lg\\" /> Discuss on the forum](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/28661)"},{"id":"/20221209-job","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/20221209-job","editUrl":"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/tree/dev/readme/news/20221209-job.md","source":"@site/news/20221209-job.md","title":"Joplin is hiring!","description":"Joplin is an open source note-taking app. Capture your thoughts and securely access them from any device.

This [Renovate tool](https://www.mend.io/free-developer-tools/renovate/) is a way to manage dependencies - it automatically finds what needs to be updated, then upgrade it to the latest version, and create a pull request. If all tests pass, we can then merge this pull request. So far we have merged 267 of these pull requests.\\n\\nUpdating Joplin packages was long due. It is necessary so that we don\'t fall behind and end up using unsupported or deprecated packages. We also benefit from bug fixes and performance improvements. It is also important in terms of security, since recent package versions usually include various security fixes.\\n\\nWe used to rely on a tool called \\"npm audit\\" to do this, however it no longer works on the Joplin codebase, and it was always risky to use it since it would update multiple packages in one command - so if something went wrong it was difficult to find the culprit.\\n\\nRenovate on the other hand upgrades packages one at a time, and run our test units to ensure everything is still working as expected. It also upgrades multiple instances of the same package across the monorepo, which is convenient to keep our code consistent. It also has a number of options to make our life easier, such as the ability to automatically merge a pull request for patch releases since this is usually safe (when a package is, for example upgraded from 1.0.1 to 1.0.3).\\n\\nAlthough Renovate automates the package upgrades it doesn\'t mean all upgrades are straightforward - our tests won\'t catch all issues, so the apps might end up being broken or cannot be compiled anymore. So there\'s manual work involved to get everything working after certain upgrades - for the most part this has been done and the apps appear to be stable so far.\\n\\nThis will however be an important part of pre-release 2.10 (or should it be 3.0?) - we hope that everything works but we may need your support to try this version and report any glitch you may have found. As always pre-release regressions have the highest priority so we aim to fix them as quickly as possible.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n[<icon icon=\\"fa-brands fa-discourse\\" size=\\"lg\\" /> Discuss on the forum](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/28366)"},{"id":"/20221012-Joplin-Company","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/20221012-Joplin-Company","editUrl":"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/tree/dev/readme/news/20221012-Joplin-Company.md","source":"@site/news/20221012-Joplin-Company.md","title":"Joplin Cloud is now part of the Joplin company","description":"As some of you may know Joplin Cloud so far has been operating under my own single-person limited company in the UK.

This company will be based in France, and will be used mainly to handle the commercial part of the project, which currently is mostly Joplin Cloud. I\'m still heading the company so there won\'t be any major change to the way the project is managed.\\n\\n## What does it mean for Joplin Cloud?\\n\\nThere will be no significant change - the website ownership simply moves from one company in the UK to one in France. The new company is still owned by myself so I will keep following the same roadmap.\\n\\n## What does it mean for the open source apps?\\n\\nOn the short term, the only visible change will be moving the non-open source assets, such as logo or trademark from the UK company to the French one. So expect a few changes in copyright notices here and there.\\n\\nIn the medium to long term, I would like to hire one or two software developers to help me with the Joplin Cloud development, because we reached a point where managing the whole project is difficult for a single person, so some help is needed. Some of their work might also touch the open source apps since both are quite related - but of course that work will remain open source too.\\n\\nAs a general rule, there will be a permanent commitment to keep the apps open source and to derive value from Joplin Cloud/Server.\\n\\nLonger term I would like to create a non-profit organisation to handle the open source applications and to make decisions about the project, as well as to decide how to allocate any funding we receive (for example from GSoC).\\n\\n## Looking forward\\n\\nThose past 6 years of developing Joplin have been an exciting and rewarding experience, thank you to all of you of the friendly and vibrant Joplin community for your contribution toward making Joplin the software it is today, and looking forward to continuing the journey together!\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n[<icon icon=\\"fa-brands fa-discourse\\" size=\\"lg\\" /> Discuss on the forum](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/27773)"},{"id":"/20220906-interview-websiteplanet","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/20220906-interview-websiteplanet","editUrl":"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/tree/dev/readme/news/20220906-interview-websiteplanet.md","source":"@site/news/20220906-interview-websiteplanet.md","title":"Joplin interview on Website Planet","description":"Website Planet has recently conducted an interview about Joplin - it may give you some insight on the current status of the project, our priorities, and future plans!

You can now create as many application profile as you wish, each with their own settings, and easily switch from one to another. The main use case is to support for example a \\"work\\" profile and a \\"personal\\" profile, to allow you to keep things independent, and each profile can sync with a different sync target.\\n\\nTo create a new profile, open **File &gt; Switch profile** and select **Create new profile**, enter the profile name and press OK. The app will automatically switch to this new profile, which you can now configure.\\n\\nTo switch back to the previous profile, again open **File &gt; Switch profile** and select **Default**.\\n\\nNote that profiles all share certain settings, such as language, font size, theme, etc. This is done so that you don\'t have reconfigure every details when switching profiles. Other settings such as sync configuration is per profile.\\n\\nThe feature is available on desktop only for now, and should be ported to mobile relatively soon.\\n\\n## Save Mermaid graph as PNG/SVG\\n\\nThis convenient feature allows exporting a Mermaid graph as a PNG or SVG image, or allows copying the image as a DataUrl, which can then be pasted in any compatible text editor. Thanks Asrient for implementing this!\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20220606-mermaid-as-png.png)\\n\\n## Publish a mini-website using Joplin Cloud\\n\\nJoplin Cloud now supports publishing a note \\"recursively\\", which means the notes and all the notes it is linked to. This allows easily publishing a simple website made of multiples and images.\\n\\nTo make use of this feature, simply select **Also publish linked notes** when publishing a note.\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20220606-publish-website.png)\\n\\n## And more!\\n\\nIn total there are 38 changes to improve the app reliability, security and usability.

There\'s about 26 improvements and 25 bugs and security fixes included - as always many of these apply to both the mobile and desktop app (see the [desktop changelog](https://joplinapp.org/help/about/changelog/desktop) and [mobile changelog](https://joplinapp.org/help/about/changelog/android/)).\\n\\nMany thanks to all the contributors who helped create this release!\\n\\nBelow are some of the more noticeable changes:\\n\\n## Notebook custom icons\\n\\nSince version 2.6 it was possible to assign an emoji icon to a notebook, and with this new version it\'s now possible to assign any custom icon. The icon may be a PNG or JPG file of any size. The app will then import the file and resize it to the correct size. To use a custom icon, follow these steps:\\n\\nRight-click on a notebook, and select \\"Edit\\":\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20220224-edit-notebook.png)\\n\\nIn the \\"Edit notebook\\" dialog, click \\"Select file...\\" and browse to your icon image:\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20220224-edit-dialog.png)\\n\\nClick \\"OK\\" and the icon will now appear next to the notebook:\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20220224-notebook-icon.png)\\n\\nThe icon can be changed only from the desktop application at the moment, but it will sync and be displayed correctly on the mobile app too.\\n\\n## Plugin API improvements\\n\\nThis version also includes a number of improvements to the plugin API, in particular it is now easier to customise the editor context menu from a plugin and dynamically add items to it depending on the context. For example, with the Rich Markdown plugin it will be possible to right-click on an image and open it, or copy it to the clipboard.\\n\\nA few additional functions have also been added to make plugin development simpler - in particular a command to open any item, whether it\'s a notebook, note, tag or attachment; and functions to work with attachments, in particular to reveal an attachment in the system file explorer, and to track changes to an attachment."},{"id":"/20220215-142000","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/20220215-142000","editUrl":"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/tree/dev/readme/news/20220215-142000.md","source":"@site/news/20220215-142000.md","title":"Automatic deletion of disabled accounts on Joplin Cloud","description":"As of 15 Feb 2022, disabled accounts on Joplin Cloud will be automatically deleted after 90 days.

The most visible one is the addition of a sort button above the note list - it allows sorting by modification date, creation date, title or by custom order, in either ascending or descending order:\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20211217-120324_0.png)\\n\\nBy default, this sort order is going to apply to all notebooks, however you can now also assign a per-notebook sort order. In this case, any sort order will be apply to that notebook only. To enable this behaviour, simply right-click on a notebook and select \\"Toggle own sort order\\":\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20211217-120324_1.png)\\n\\nThanks to Kenichi Kobayashi for developing this feature!\\n\\n**Support for notebook icons**\\n\\nIt is now possible to associate icons with notebooks no both the desktop and mobile applications. To do so, right-click on a notebook and selected \\"Edit\\".\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20211217-120324_2.png)\\n\\nThis will open the new notebook dialog from which can change the title and assign an icon. For now the icons are emojis but perhaps custom icons could be supported later on.\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20211217-120324_3.png)\\n\\n**Allow collaborating on encrypted notebooks using Joplin Cloud**\\n\\nThanks to the encryption improvements in the previous Joplin versions it is now possible to share and collaborated on encrypted notebooks, when synchronising with Joplin Cloud (or Joplin Server).\\n\\nTo get this working, you and the recipient will need to have Joplin 2.6 and the person who shares will need to have encryption enabled. After that most of the process is handled automatically by the apps - in particular it will automatically generate and share the required encryption keys for each users.\\n\\n**Improved synchronisation startup speed**\\n\\nSynchronisation is also a bit faster in this release due to an optimisation on the startup process. When syncing, the app needs to acquire a lock, which may be time consuming since it requires making multiple requests. This has now been optimised so that less requests are necessary and also each request consumes less resources. This will have a positive impact on Joplin Cloud in particular, but you should also see improvements with Joplin Server and smaller improvements with the other sync targets.\\n\\n**Improved Markdown editor split view scrolling**\\n\\nKenichi Kobayashi made some great improvements to the Markdown editor scrolling in this release. The issue before was that the editor on the left and the viewer on the right would often not be in sync, in particular if the note contains several images and other media.\\n\\nWith Kenichi\'s change the editor and viewer stay nicely in sync, regardless of the note content. In fact it looks a bit like magic when you scroll through large notes - notice in particular how each side appear to wait for the other or speed up in order to make sure both sides are aligned as well possible. Kenichi provides a nice technical documentation about the feature [here](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/5512#issuecomment-931277022).\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wbs5XZR0oeU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wbs5XZR0oeU)\\n\\n**Improved and optimised S3 synchronisation**\\n\\nThanks to the efforts of Lee Matos, synchronisation with S3 is now more reliable and errors are also better handled. The underlying S3 SDK has also been upgraded from v2 to v3 which results in a smaller executable size (about 3-5 MB depending on the operating system)\\n\\n**Export notes as self-contained HTML files**\\n\\nExporting a single note as HTML is now more user friendly as all images, scripts, styles and other attachments are all packed into a single HTML file (Previously it would create multiples files and directories). This makes it easier to share the complete note with someone who doesn\'t have Joplin.\\n\\n**Other changes and bug fixes**\\n\\nThis release includes a total of 19 new features and improvements and 16 bug fixes.

If that happens the migration will fail and the server will not start.\\n\\nIf that happens, you\'ll need to decide what to do with the data, as it\'s not possible to automatically decide.

You\'ll want to delete the corresponding item_id from the user_items table too.\\n\\nBut really in most cases you should be fine.

Here\'s an overview of the changes:\\n\\n### Support for Markdown + Front Matter\\n\\nMarkdown + Front Matter is a format that allows attaching metadata, such as tags, creation date, or geolocation to a Markdown file. This is done by adding a block of YAML code (a \\"front matter\\") at the top of the file.\\n\\nThanks to Caleb John\'s efforts the Joplin desktop and CLI applications now support importing and exporting these files. When exporting, we try to preserve as much metadata as possible, while still keeping it the formatting user friendly.\\n\\nHere\'s an example, with the Front Matter at the top, delimited by \\"---\\", and the text below.\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20211031-115215_0.png)\\n\\nMarkdown + Front Matter is an excellent way to share notes with someone who doesn\'t have Joplin, to backup notes in a durable format (since no third-party application is needed to read it), and also to export notes to other applications, or to import them.\\n\\nAs with the regular Markdown exporter, the images and attachments are also exported.\\n\\n### Add support for callback URLs\\n\\nCallback URLs is a semi-standard that defines how certain resources in an application can be accessed via URLs. Either to view the resource, or to perform certain actions, such as deletion, creation, etc.\\n\\nJoplin now support callback URLs to open notes, notebooks and folders. To do so, right click on a note and select \\"Copy external link\\":\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20211031-115215_1.png)\\n\\nThat would give you a URL such as this:\\n\\n> joplin://x-callback-url/openNote?id=b7a7b93281f54d928612eea550f33a7f\\n\\nThen if you click it from outside the app, the app will open and select this particular note. In practice such a feature allows third-party application to interact with Joplin by creating links that can be opened from outside. For example, you may use a different application for project planning, then link to the individual notes for more details about each task.\\n\\nMany thanks to Roman Musin for adding the feature!\\n\\n### Improved end-to-end encryption support\\n\\nThe series of quiet but major changes to the end-to-end encryption support continue in this new verison. One goal is still to allow sharing notebooks while encryption is enabled.\\n\\nTo that end, v2.5 includes support for RSA public-private key pairs. If you have encryption enabled, they will be automatically generated when you synchronise by the mobile, desktop or CLI applications. Later on, these keys will be used to allow sharing encrypted notebooks.\\n\\nThe second goal of these E2EE changes is to simplify the system enough that it can be enabled by default. To that end, the master password dialog and encryption screen have been improved. An option to reset the master password is now also available.\\n\\n### Various other improvements and bug fixes\\n\\nIn total this release includes about 11 other bug fixes and improvements. There was in particular several improvements to the share features. It is now also possible for a share recipient to leave the shared notebook.\\n\\n### Mobile app update\\n\\nAs always the mobile apps (to be released soon) benefit from several of the above changes since they share the same codebase as the desktop app.\\n\\nSpecific to the mobile version 2.5 are some improvements to the beta editor - in particular the layout has been cleaned up, and the first word of sentences is now automatically capitalised, which makes typing notes easier.

Here\'s what\'s new in this release:\\n\\n### Sync Wizard Dialog\\n\\nA new Sync Wizard Dialog has been added to simplify setting up sync on new clients.\\n\\nThe dialog shows the main sync targets, their differences, and makes it easy to choose one and start synchronising. This is mostly aimed at new users or those perhaps less technical. Those who are self hosting or using complex setups will still easily find what they need from a link on that dialog (or in Config &gt; Synchronisation like before).\\n\\nSync setup on mobile has been slightly improved too - now on a new client, instead of asking you to sync with Dropbox directly (which may not be what you want), it jumps to the Config &gt; Synchronisation section where you can select the sync target\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20210929-144036_0.png)\\n\\n### Disable synchronisation\\n\\nIt\'s a small change but something that\'s been asked many time - it\'s now possible to disable synchronisation entirely by selecting \\"None\\" as a sync target. Previously that could be done in a hacky way, by selecting a non-configured sync target. Now it\'s clearer and easier to do.\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20210929-144036_1.png)\\n\\n### Add back support for deprecated plugins\\n\\nRecently some plugins stopped working because deprecated plugin APIs had been removed. It had been planned for a long time but I suspect the warnings weren\'t visible enough so plugin developers didn\'t act on them, and as a result many plugins stopped working.\\n\\nThis is now fixed in the latest version. A selected number of plugins will have access to these old deprecated APIs, which means they will start working again. This was mainly affecting ambrt\'s plugins such as \\"Convert Text To New Note\\" or the popular \\"Embed Search\\" plugin.\\n\\n### Add support for recommended plugins\\n\\nAs mentioned in an earlier post, we now support [recommended plugins](https://www.patreon.com/posts/introducing-in-55618802). These recommended plugins appear on top when searching and are identified by a small crown.\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20210929-144036_2.png)\\n\\n### End to End Encryption improvements\\n\\nLike most recent releases, v2.4 includes a few improvement to the End to End Encryption (E2EE) system. The goal is to make it easier to use, to make it more reliable and to support the future use case of sharing encrypted notebooks or notes.\\n\\nOne important change is the support for a master password. This single password will be responsible to encrypt various keys, including some that will be automatically generated. Thanks to this, it won\'t be necessary to ask to enter a new password every time a key needs to be encrypted, since the master password can be used. It will also be easier to manage since you\'ll only have one password to remember instead of a different one for each notebook you might have shared.\\n\\nFinally, it\'s now possible to disable a master key. What it means is that it will no longer show up in the list of master keys, and will also no longer generate a warning asking you to enter the password. In some case you might have forgotten it and no longer need it key, so you can now disable it.\\n\\n### Custom CSS\\n\\nThis version also introduces a few internal change to better support custom CSS. In particular the colours now come from a CSS file, which could potentially be overridden, and new UI elements are styled using stylesheets, which likewise could be overridden.\\n\\nThose are just first steps, but eventually these changes will make it easier to style the UI and create new themes.\\n\\n### Bug fixes\\n\\nThis release also includes about 30 various bug fixes and improvements.\\n\\nA notable one is a fix for GotoAnything, which recently wasn\'t working on first try.\\n\\nThe plugin screen has also been improved so that search works even when GitHub is down or blocked, as it is in China in particular."},{"id":"/20210901-113415","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/20210901-113415","editUrl":"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/tree/dev/readme/news/20210901-113415.md","source":"@site/news/20210901-113415.md","title":"Introducing recommended plugins in the next Joplin version","description":"A common request from new users is how to know which plugin is safe to install or not.

In fact probably all of them are safe but as a new user that\'s not necessarily easy to know. So to help with this, the next version of Joplin will support recommended plugins - those will be plugins that meet our standards of quality and performance, and they will be indicated by a small crown tag inside the plugin box. Recommended plugins will also appear on top when searching.\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20210901-113415_0.png)\\n\\nFor now, since we don\'t have a review process, the recommended plugins are those developed by the Joplin team and frequent contributors, because we know those are safe to use.\\n\\nLater we might have a review process and add more recommended plugins. That being said, in the meantime even if a plugin is not marked as recommended, there\'s a good chance it is still safe and have good performance too. Often you can search for it on the forum and if it\'s active with many users commenting, you\'re most likely good to go.\\n\\nBut if there\'s any doubt, the recommended tag is a good way to be sure."},{"id":"/20210831-154354","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/20210831-154354","editUrl":"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/tree/dev/readme/news/20210831-154354.md","source":"@site/news/20210831-154354.md","title":"Joplin Cloud is officially production ready!","description":"Joplin Cloud has been out of beta for a few weeks now and since then it has been quietly running without any troubles.

There is no known bugs and the service is running smoothly so it\'s now safe to say that it is production ready!\\n\\nAs a reminder, Joplin Cloud is meant to provide a more seamless Joplin experience - if you want to quickly get started, it\'s as easy as downloading the app and getting a Joplin Cloud account. Besides improved sync performance, that will give you the ability to collaborate on notebooks with others, as well as publishing and sharing notes.\\n\\nOf course Joplin still supports other sync options such as Nextcloud, Dropbox and OneDrive or AWS S3. You can also self host using Joplin Server. The advantage of Joplin Cloud being that you don\'t need to maintain a server yourself - for a small fee you\'ll get that taken care of.\\n\\nAdditionally, subscribing to Joplin Cloud is a great way to support the project as a whole, including the open source applications. Such support is needed in the long term to provide bug and security fixes, add new features, and provide support.\\n\\nAt some level it is also an experiment, to see if such a service is financially viable and can allow me to work full time on the project. This is certainly something I would like, and perhaps Joplin Cloud combined with your donations will allow that."},{"id":"/20210804-085003","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/20210804-085003","editUrl":"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/tree/dev/readme/news/20210804-085003.md","source":"@site/news/20210804-085003.md","title":"How to start your subscription if you have a free Joplin Cloud Beta...","description":"For anyone with a beta account, if you would like to keep using it after the end of the trial period, there is now a button to do this from the Joplin Cloud home page: If you click on it you will b...","date":"2021-08-04T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 4, 2021","tags":[],"readingTime":0.79,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"created":"2021-08-04T08:50:03.000Z","source_url":"https://www.patreon.com/posts/how-to-start-if-54505640","sidebar_label":"How to start your subscription if you have a free Joplin Cloud Beta account","date":"2021-08-04T00:00:00.000Z","title":"How to start your subscription if you have a free Joplin Cloud Beta...","description":"For anyone with a beta account, if you would like to keep using it after the end of the trial period, there is now a button to do this from the Joplin Cloud home page: If you click on it you will b...","image":"https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/cozic/optimized/2X/e/e2b54352d0e401e692a75817f6faa0432322c405_2_517x222.png"},"prevItem":{"title":"Joplin Cloud is officially production ready!","permalink":"/news/20210831-154354"},"nextItem":{"title":"New beta editor for the mobile app","permalink":"/news/20210729-103234"}},"content":"<div className=\\"donate-links\\">\\n\\n[![Donate using PayPal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/badges/Donate-PayPal-green.svg)](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?business=E8JMYD2LQ8MMA&no_recurring=0&item_name=I+rely+on+donations+to+maintain+and+improve+the+Joplin+open+source+project.+Thank+you+for+your+help+-+it+makes+a+difference%21&currency_code=EUR) [![Sponsor on GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/badges/GitHub-Badge.svg)](https://github.com/sponsors/laurent22/) [![Become a patron](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/badges/Patreon-Badge.svg)](https://www.patreon.com/joplin) [![Donate using IBAN](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/badges/Donate-IBAN.svg)](https://joplinapp.org/donate/#donations)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\nFor anyone with a beta account, if you would like to keep using it after the end of the trial period, there is now a button to do this from the Joplin Cloud home page:\\n\\n<img height=\\"222\\" src=\\"https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/cozic/optimized/2X/e/e2b54352d0e401e692a75817f6faa0432322c405_2_517x222.png\\" width=\\"517\\"/>\\n\\nIf you click on it you will be sent to the Plans page via a special link.

It had a lot of useful content but finding your way was tricky and, for new users, it wasn\'t clear what Joplin was about. Finding out how to install the app wasn\'t obvious since the download buttons were lost in the clutter of information.\\n\\nSo the new website includes a front page with clear goals:\\n\\n- Allows people to easily download the app - for that there\'s a large Download button at the top and bottom of the page. It redirects to a page that automatically picks the version based on your operating system.\\n- Showcase the application key features. The [key features post](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/what-are-the-key-features-of-joplin/5837) on the forum helped narrow down what Joplin is about, so there are sections about the web clipper, the open source nature of the app, encryption, synchronisation, customisation and the ability to create multimedia notes.\\n- The top screenshots have also been updated (the previous one was showing a dev version from 2016, before the app was even released). As a nod to Scott Joplin, the screenshot shows an imaginary plan to open a vintage piano store, with various tasks, tables, documents and images attached, to showcase Joplin features.\\n- Finally there\'s a Press section, which includes extracts from some cool articles that have been written about the app.\\n\\nAlso many thanks to everyone who voted and contributed to the tagline discussion! It helped narrow down what the tagline should be, along with the equally important description below.

It\'s been present since version 2.x and the feature is getting close to be stable.\\n\\n**How does it work?**\\n\\nWhen connected to Joplin Server (or the upcoming Joplin Cloud service), a new \\"Share notebook\\" menu item is available when right-clicking on a notebook.\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20210621-104753_0.png)\\n\\nClick on it, and it will display a new dialog where you can add any number of recipients. Those recipients also need to be on the same Joplin Server instance. From this dialog you can also remove a recipient or unshare the whole notebook, in which case it will be removed from everybody\'s note collection, except yours.\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20210621-104753_1.png)\\n\\nOnce this is done, the recipient(s) will receive a notification in Joplin the next time they synchronise their data:\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20210621-104753_2.png)\\n\\nThen, finally, once the invitation is accepted, Joplin will download all the shared notebooks and notes. A shared notebook is denoted by the usual Share icon. Now the invited user can read or modify the shared notes, add attachments, etc. and the changes will be visible to everyone with access to the notebook.\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20210621-104753_3.png)\\n\\n**What\'s the availability of the notebook sharing feature?**\\n\\nThe notebook sharing feature is available on Joplin Server and Joplin Cloud.\\n\\nOn desktop, you can share notebooks and of course view or modify any notebook that has been shared with you.\\n\\nOn mobile and CLI, you cannot currently share notebooks, but you can view or modify any notebook that has been shared with you.\\n\\n**If I share a notebook with someone, what access do they have?**\\n\\nCurrently they have full access to the data, including reading, writing and deleting notebooks or notes. In a future version, access control might be implemented. For example, to only give read-only access to the shared notebook.\\n\\n**What can actually be shared?**\\n\\nAll the sub-notebooks, notes and resources within the shared notebook are shared.\\n\\n**Does it work with End-To-End-Encryption?**\\n\\nYes and no. It is possible to use the share notebook feature even with E2EE enabled, however any shared notebook or note will not be encrypted, otherwise you would have had to give your master key password to the people you share with, which you\'d probably not want to do.\\n\\nIn a future version, this might be supported. For example by automatically creating a new master key for the shared notebook. You would then provide the recipients with that master key password.\\n\\n**What can it be used for?**\\n\\nSome ideas:\\n\\n- Plan a trip with friends or within a small organisation. For example, the notes could contain the maps, hotel and flight reservations, etc. or any document or note relevant to the trip. And all participants would have access to them.\\n- Work on a project with colleagues. Everybody can access various work-related documents, add to them, modify them, etc. That could serve as a knowledge base for a project.\\n- Another possible use, which has been requested many times, is to support multiple profiles. You could create a main profile that have access to all notes, and in there create a Work and Personal notebook. Then you would create a separate account for work. You can then share your Work notebook with that other account. That way the work account will only have access to the Work notebooks. You can use this technique in various ways to split your notebooks between multiple accounts and ensure strict separation between datasets."},{"id":"/20210518-085514","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/20210518-085514","editUrl":"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/tree/dev/readme/news/20210518-085514.md","source":"@site/news/20210518-085514.md","title":"The six Google Summer of Code projects and students have been selec...","description":"Google has reviewed the project proposals we had submitted and all students have been approved.

Even the database rows are now typed thanks to sql-ts.\\n\\nSo anyway TypeScript has been a big win for the project as it made it possible to refactor and modernise many parts of it in a safe way, and make the code future proof and easier to work with!

Like last year, we would appreciate any help with managing the event - if you are interested in **being a tutor**, or if you can **help with welcoming new students** and answering their questions, please let us know!\\n\\nSo far, we have @CalebJohn, @PackElend, @tessus and myself as potential tutors."},{"id":"/20210105-153008","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/20210105-153008","editUrl":"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/tree/dev/readme/news/20210105-153008.md","source":"@site/news/20210105-153008.md","title":"Joplin Server pre-release is now available","description":"The first release of Joplin Server is now available as a pre-release: https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/packages/server/README.md What does it sync with?

Long term, the goal is to add collaboration features:\\n\\n- Sharing a note with anyone, using a URL. When the note is changed, the content at the URL is changed too.\\n- Sharing a notebook with a user on the same Joplin Server instance. For example, if you share a notebook with another user, that user will see this notebook in their desktop or mobile app, and will be able to edit the notes, etc.\\n\\n### Any improvement over Nextcloud?\\n\\nFor now, one benefit of using Joplin Server, compared to Nextcloud or WebDAV in general, is that it is much faster and resource efficient. I\'ve done a basic test with Nextcloud and Joplin Server running on the same server. Both have mostly default settings (except Nextcloud which uses Redis for file locks):\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20210105-153008_0.png)\\n\\nWhy is it so much faster? I assume it\'s in part because the WebDAV protocol is terribly inefficient. It sends unnecessarily large XML blobs for every request, which are time consuming to download and parse. It also doesn\'t support delta sync (unlike Joplin Server), which means the complete file list needs to be downloaded before syncing in order to compare the local and remote items.\\n\\nFinally it\'s possible that Nextcloud file locking system means an overhead on each request. It shouldn\'t be much since it\'s handled by Redis but who knows. Joplin Server doesn\'t need locking as data consistency is handled by the clients.\\n\\nSo just by following common sense and transferring only the required data in a sane format (JSON), we can have something more performant. In my case, I appreciate that the mobile app no longer freezes when it starts synchronising - before it would do that due to the large XML WebDAV file that needs to be parsed.\\n\\n### Stability\\n\\nI\'ve been using it with the desktop and mobile app for a few weeks now and haven\'t had any issue so far. The server also passes all the existing sync-related test units (sync, e2ee and lock handling) so I\'m reasonably confident it can already be used. As always though, keep making backups in case there\'s any issue.\\n\\n### Suggestions are welcome\\n\\nThis is still a pre-release and if you notice anything off please let me know. In particular, I believe it doesn\'t gzip responses, so that will need to be added. The process also doesn\'t restart when it crashes, which could be solved with pm2.\\n\\nAlso if you have any idea on how to make installation easier, your feedback is welcome."},{"id":"/20210104-131645","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/20210104-131645","editUrl":"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/tree/dev/readme/news/20210104-131645.md","source":"@site/news/20210104-131645.md","title":"PDF viewer, audio and video player now in Joplin 1.5","description":"The latest version features of Joplin features a few improvements to make it easier to preview various media files.

The [plugin API](/help/api) in particular has been significantly expanded, based on the developer feedback, so that more types of plugin are possible now, and indeed a few plugin concepts have started appearing on the forums. In particular all this could be done now:\\n\\n- Access notes, folders, etc. via the data API\\n- Add a view to display custom data using HTML/CSS/JS\\n- Create a dialog to display information and get input from the user\\n- Create a new command and associate a toolbar button or menu item with it\\n- Get access to the note currently being edited and modify it\\n- Listen to various events and run code when they happen\\n- Hook into the application to set additional options and customise Joplin\'s behaviour\\n- Create a module to export or import data into Joplin\\n- Define new settings and setting sections, and get/set them from the plugin\\n- Create a new Markdown plugin to render custom markup.\\n- Create an editor plugin to modify low-level the behaviour of the Markdown editor (CodeMirror)\\n\\n**Plugin JPL format and configuration screen**\\n\\nThe plugin configuration screen has also been updated so that it\'s possible to import the new JPL (**J**oplin **PL**ugin) format and to enable/disable as well as uninstall plugins.\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20201130-145937_0.png)\\n\\n**What\'s next?**\\n\\nIt is now possible to create new plugins, package them into the JPL format, and to install them into the app.\\n\\nThe last piece missing is a way to discover and share plugins, and a way to update them easily, basically what we need is an online package manager. It is not clear yet how this is going to be done, but one idea would be to have a GitHub repository where anyone could submit or update a plugin, then the app would connect to that repository to make it easy to install new plugins.

Anjula developed over the past few months a system to allow configuring the keymap shortcuts, and created a nice editor for it. \xa0Here is what he has to say:\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nJoplin desktop application supports keyboard shortcuts to a certain \xa0degree. However, there wasn\'t an option for users to configure keyboard \xa0shortcuts according to their preferences. My project was to implement a \xa0keyboard shortcut editor along with the necessary integration.\\n\\nCustom keyboard shortcuts would be a great addition for all Joplin \xa0users including power users and those who are migrating to Joplin from \xa0other note-taking applications. People also do not have the same \xa0keyboard layout; not everyone has F6 necessarily. It would solve \xa0conflicts between different preferences of workflows, and increase \xa0discoverability for all keyboard shortcuts.\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20200915-091108_0.png)\\n\\n### Back-end service for handling keymapping-related functionality\\n\\nKeymapService builds an in-memory keymap based on the default keymap \xa0configuration. The default keymap configuration may vary from platform \xa0to platform. Essentially, the in-memory keymap binds a keyboard shortcut \xa0for some command of Joplin. Clients of KeymapService may obtain the \xa0keyboard shortcuts for some commands, and/or alter the keymap via the \xa0provided methods.\\n\\nKeymapService also allows altering the keymap via a keymap file, \xa0which is located in the profile directory. Contents of this keymap file \xa0will take higher priority than the default keymap configuration, and \xa0will replace the default keyboard shortcuts.\\n\\nIt is guaranteed that the keymap always stays pristine with proper validation.\\n\\n### Keyboard shortcut editor with the necessary functionality to alter the keymap\\n\\nDepending on the interfaces of KeymapService, the Keyboard shortcut editor allows the user to,\\n\\n- View all the available commands and their respective keyboard shortcuts\\n- Change, or disable a keyboard shortcut for some command\\n- Restore a keyboard shortcut to its default value\\n- Export all changes to a keymap file (in JSON format)\\n- Import changes from an exported keymap file\\n- Perform a simple search to locate some shortcut\\n\\nChanges performed to the keymap will be reflected immediately in the \xa0application user-interface as well as in the keymap file located in the \xa0profile directory. The editor will also perform continuous validation to \xa0ensure that the keymap will not enter a dirty-state. For example, it \xa0won\'t allow the user to use the same shortcut for two or more commands.\\n\\nThe complete report with details of code contributions can be found [here.](https://gist.github.com/rahulbansal3005/3d566668a94c882d9f56811e18a2b17f)"},{"id":"/20200913-163730","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/20200913-163730","editUrl":"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/tree/dev/readme/news/20200913-163730.md","source":"@site/news/20200913-163730.md","title":"Version 1.1: Search engine update","description":"In this series of posts, I will introduce the changes that are coming in version 1.1 (which in fact is already available as a pre-release).

Naveen has made an excellent job implementing various search engine features, including advanced filters, support for Okapi BM25 scoring algorithm, and fuzzy search. Here is what he has to say:\\n\\n### What got done\\n\\nThe project consisted of three parts:\\n\\n1. Make search better by introducing additional search filters. (e.g., tags, notebook, type)\\n2. Make the ranking of search results better by implementing the [Okapi BM25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25) relevance function.\\n3. Make fuzzy search possible.\\n\\n### Code contributions\\n\\n1. [**All: Add search filters**](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/3213)Joplin\'s search had been using the Full-Text Search(FTS) offered by \xa0SQLite directly. So though it was fast, it was not versatile. For \xa0example, we can\'t restrict the search scope to a particular notebook or \xa0search based on tags.The current search implementation fixes most of these problems. It \xa0provides a better abstraction over FTS, supporting many new filters. The \xa0documentation for the new search filters can be found [here.](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin#searching)\\n2. [**All: Weigh notes using Okapi BM25 score**](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/3454)Joplin used a ranking function based on the number of times the search query occurs in the note and how close they are.But there are better ways to rank notes, considering not just the \xa0number of times a word appears, but how common it is. Words like \\"the\\" \xa0is in most notes, while words like \\"zebra\\" are not common and should be \xa0considered more relevant.The new search implementation uses [Okapi BM25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25) \xa0as the ranking function. It ranks a set of documents based on the query \xa0terms appearing in each document, regardless of their proximity.\\n3. [**Desktop: Fuzzy search**](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/3632)We\'ve added support for fuzzy search. It doesn\'t replace the need to put \xa0* at the end if you want to do a prefix search. But it does let you be a \xa0bit more relaxed about the exact spelling. Searching for \\"tomatos\\" will \xa0also give you results for \\"tomatoes\\". (This feature isn\'t released yet, \xa0but will be soon)\\n\\nIt has been a pleasure working with Laurent and Caleb. They did an excellent job as mentors.\\n\\nI hope these new features will be useful to many people. I plan to \xa0continue as a member of the Joplin community and help in whatever way I \xa0can."},{"id":"/20200906-172325","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/20200906-172325","editUrl":"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/tree/dev/readme/news/20200906-172325.md","source":"@site/news/20200906-172325.md","title":"Improving the sync process in Joplin","description":"The latest version of Joplin includes a mechanism to upgrade the structure of a sync target.

When you startup the app you will be asked to upgrade before being able to sync. Once you start the process, the app will briefly display an information screen, upgrade the sync target, and then restart the app. You\u2019ll then be able to sync with the new sync target format. That first upgrade is quite simple as the goal for now is to put the mechanism in place and verify that it works well.\\n\\nFrom a user perspective this feature doesn\u2019t do anything visible, although [it caused some issues](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/3692#issuecomment-685679213), so one might wonder why it\u2019s even there. This post is meant to clarify this.\\n\\nThe structure of the sync target hasn\u2019t really changed since the day Joplin was released. It works well however it has some shortcomings that should be fixed eventually for sync to remain performant.\\n\\nThere are also various improvements that could be made but were not previously possible due to the lack of an upgrade mechanism. I have listed below the 5 main limitations or issues with the current sync process and how they could be fixed:\\n\\n### No upper limit on the number of items\\n\\nJoplin\u2019s UI works well even with millions of notes, however the sync target will keep getting slower and slower as more files are added to it. File systems often have a limit to the number of files they can support in a directory. One user also has reached [the limit of 150,000 items on OneDrive](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/limit-on-the-number-of-child-items-was-reached/3804).\\n\\nFor now, this is not a big issue because most users don\u2019t have millions of items, but as more web pages are being clipped (clipped pages often contain many small resources and images) and more note revisions are created (one note can have hundreds of revisions), this issue might start affecting more users.\\n\\nOne way to solve this issue would be to split the sync items into multiple directories. For example if we split the main directory into 100 sub-directories, it will be possible to have 15,000,000 OneDrive items instead of 150,000. Another way would be to support note archiving, as described below. How exactly we\u2019ll handle this problem is still to be defined, but there are certainly ways.\\n\\n### Not possible to prioritise downloads\\n\\nCurrently, when syncing, the items are downloaded in a random way. So it might download some notes, then some tags and notebooks, then back to downloading notes, etc. For small sync operations it doesn\u2019t matter, but large ones, like when setting up a new device, it is very inefficient. For example, the app might download hundreds of note revisions or tags, but won\u2019t display anything for a while because it won\u2019t have downloaded notebooks or notes.\\n\\nA simple improvement would be to group the items by type on the sync target. So all notebook items together, all tags together, etc. Doing so means when syncing we can first download the notebooks, then the notes, which means something will be displayed almost immediately in the app, allowing the user to start using it. Then later less important items like tags or note revisions will be downloaded.\\n\\n### End-to-end encryption is hard to setup\\n\\nCurrently, the encryption settings is a property of the clients. What it means it that when you setup a new client, it doesn\u2019t know whether the other clients use encryption or not. It\u2019s going to guess more or less based on the data on the sync target. You can also force it to use encryption but this has drawbacks and often mean a new master key is going to be created, even though there might already be one on the sync target.\\n\\nE2EE works well once it\u2019s setup, but doing so can be tricky and possibly confusing - if you didn\u2019t follow [this guide](https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/sync/e2ee) to the letter, you might end up with multiple master keys, or sending decrypted notes to an encrypted target.\\n\\nA way to solve this would be to make the E2EE settings a property of the sync target. Concretely there would be a file that tells if E2EE is enabled or not, and maybe some way to quickly get the master key. It would simplify setting up encryption a lot and make it more secure (because you won\u2019t be able to send non-encrypted notes to an encrypted sync target). When you setup a new client, the client will know immediately if it\u2019s an encrypted target or not and set the client accordingly.\\n\\n### Old notes that never change should be handled differently\\n\\nIt would be more efficient to treat old notes differently by allowing the user to \u201carchive\u201d them. An archived note would be read-only. Then one idea could be to group all these archived notes into a ZIP file on the sync target. Doing so means that the initial sync would be much faster (instead of downloading hundred of small files, which is slow, it will download one large file, which is fast). It would also make the structure more scalable - you could keep several years of archived notes on the sync target while keeping sync fast and efficient.\\n\\n### The resource directory should be renamed\\n\\nThe folder that contains file attachments is named \u201c.resources\u201d on the sync target. This causes troubles because certain platforms will hide directories that start with dot \u201c.\u201d, and perhaps they will be excluded from backup or skipped when moved somewhere else. Being able to upgrade the sync target means we can rename this folder to just \u201cresources\u201d instead.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThat\u2019s obviously a lot of possible improvements and it won\u2019t be done overnight, but having the sync upgrade mechanism in place means we can start considering these options. Some of these, such as renaming the \u201cresources\u201d dir are simpler and could be done relatively soon. Perhaps other more complex ones will be group within one sync target upgrade to minimise disruption. In any case, I hope this clarifies the reason for this recent sync upgrade and that it gives some ideas of what to expect in the future."},{"id":"/20200708-192444","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/20200708-192444","editUrl":"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/tree/dev/readme/news/20200708-192444.md","source":"@site/news/20200708-192444.md","title":"New config screen design is ready!","description":"The design put the menu bar on the left, which I think makes sense, as it\'s consistent with the main screen UI.

To do this, click on the attachment or, if it\'s an image, right-click on it and select open. The file will then be watched by the application and any change you make will be saved to Joplin, and synchronised.\\n\\n**New Markdown editor**\\n\\nA new Markdown editor (Code Mirror) is now included with Joplin. For now it is for beta testing only so you need to manually enable it in the options in \\"Note\\" =&gt; \\"Use CodeMirror as the code editor\\". The goal of this new editor is to address several of the issues that have affected the previous Markdown editor and that were either hard or impossible to fix, in particular:\\n\\n- Support for spell checking. Note that it is not yet implemented in the new editor but it at least can be done now.\\n- Variable font size. The previous editor would not allow this, which would cause various issues.\\n- Search within the Markdown text. Previously it was only possible to searched with the note viewer but with this editor it should be possible to search within the Markdown text too.\\n- Improved support for emojis.\\n- Improved support for Asian languages and Russian.\\n\\nIf possible, please help test this new editor and [report any issue in the forum](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/)! (or GitHub)\\n\\n**Manual ordering of notes**\\n\\nYou can now manually order the notes within the notebook. For this to work, make sure you choose \\"Custom order\\" in the menu View =&gt; Sort Notes by\\n\\n**Support for system keychain on macOS and Windows**\\n\\nOne of the issues mentioned in the [security audit](https://www.patreon.com/posts/joplin-informal-35719724) was that certain sensitive settings, like Nextcloud or encryption passwords were saved unencrypted in the Joplin profile. This new release will make use of the system keychain when it is available and move the sensitive settings to it. You don\'t need to do anything to make use of this feature, it is automatically enabled in this release.\\n\\nCurrently this is supported on macOS and Windows. It is disabled of course for the portable version, and is also not currently enabled for Linux due to a build issue and less consistent support than on macOS and Windows.\\n\\n**Support for system theme**\\n\\nThe app can now auto-detect the system theme and switch to it automatically. This essentially adds support for system \\"dark mode\\", which are now common on most operating systems. You may choose a preferred \\"light\\" theme and \\"dark\\" theme in the option.\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20200607-112720_0.png)"},{"id":"/20200606-151446","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/20200606-151446","editUrl":"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/tree/dev/readme/news/20200606-151446.md","source":"@site/news/20200606-151446.md","title":"New pre-release coming soon","description":"Now that the GSoC changes have been merged and the application made more stable following the rewrite of the note editor code, a new pre-release will be available soon.

One key point is that we didn\u2019t expect Joplin to get that \xa0much interest as this is a relatively new project, and as a result we \xa0had trouble managing the number of proposals and pull requests we got. \xa0We also quickly ran out of \u201cGood first issues\u201d, which means for students \xa0coming a bit late it wasn\u2019t clear what you could work on.\\n\\nSo next year, we\u2019ll restrict a bit the number and the type of pull \xa0requests each student can make. Ideally we\u2019d prefer if you work on only \xa0one or two medium-sized pull requests, rather than several small ones, \xa0so that you can really focus on it and give your best work. Of course, \xa0that makes it also more manageable for us as there will be less pull \xa0requests to review. I wasn\u2019t too happy with the way I was reviewing \xa0sometimes, giving short and not very helpful comments at time, as I was \xa0trying to get as many PRs done as possible. Instead it would be best to \xa0do less but do it better.\\n\\nAnother point is that we should make it clear how many slots we\u2019re \xa0likely to get. We cannot know for sure, it\u2019s up to Google, but we can at \xa0least give an estimate. That way, you can decide whether it makes sense \xa0to invest your time in the project, or if it would be best to pick a \xa0different, less busy project.\\n\\nIn any case, this is a learning process for all, and we aim to improve over time.\\n\\nAlso a quick update on the number of pull requests - so far we have reviewed and processed 104 pull requests for GSoC (59 of which were merged) and there are still 32 pull requests that need to be reviewed and merged. So that\'s a lot of improvements and bug fixes on Joplin in the coming weeks.\\n\\nMany thanks to all the students who joined us this year! We \xa0definitely appreciate your time and contribution on this project, \xa0whether it\u2019s with your pull requests or via your participation on the \xa0forum, and you\u2019re of course welcome to give it another try next year, or \xa0to stay around in the community.\\n\\nAlso many thanks to our mentors [@PackElend](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/u/packelend), [@bedwardly-down](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/u/bedwardly-down), [@mic704b](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/u/mic704b), [@tessus](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/u/tessus), [@CalebJohn](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/u/calebjohn), [@rullzer](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/u/rullzer) for their help coordinating all this, writing the documentation and reviewing pull request and proposals!"},{"id":"/20200406-224254","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/20200406-224254","editUrl":"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/tree/dev/readme/news/20200406-224254.md","source":"@site/news/20200406-224254.md","title":"Joplin informal encryption and security audit results","description":"Joplin encryption, and in particular the E2EE system used during synchronisation, was recently audited by Isaac Potoczny-Jones, CEO of Tozny and this is what he had to say: I was looking through yo...","date":"2020-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 6, 2020","tags":[],"readingTime":7.375,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"url":"https://www.patreon.com/posts/joplin-informal-35719724","published_at":"2020-04-06T21:42:54.000Z","sidebar_label":"Joplin informal encryption and security audit results","date":"2020-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Joplin informal encryption and security audit results","description":"Joplin encryption, and in particular the E2EE system used during synchronisation, was recently audited by Isaac Potoczny-Jones, CEO of Tozny and this is what he had to say: I was looking through yo..."},"prevItem":{"title":"GSoC 2020 students have been announced by Google","permalink":"/news/20200505-181736"},"nextItem":{"title":"Experimental WYSIWYG editor in Joplin","permalink":"/news/20200314-001555"}},"content":"<div className=\\"donate-links\\">\\n\\n[![Donate using PayPal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/badges/Donate-PayPal-green.svg)](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?business=E8JMYD2LQ8MMA&no_recurring=0&item_name=I+rely+on+donations+to+maintain+and+improve+the+Joplin+open+source+project.+Thank+you+for+your+help+-+it+makes+a+difference%21&currency_code=EUR) [![Sponsor on GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/badges/GitHub-Badge.svg)](https://github.com/sponsors/laurent22/) [![Become a patron](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/badges/Patreon-Badge.svg)](https://www.patreon.com/joplin) [![Donate using IBAN](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/badges/Donate-IBAN.svg)](https://joplinapp.org/donate/#donations)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\nJoplin encryption, and in particular the E2EE system used during synchronisation, was recently audited by Isaac Potoczny-Jones, CEO of [Tozny](https://tozny.com) and this is what he had to say:\\n\\n> I was looking through your encryption implementation for Joplin and I have a few comments and concerns.

[Source](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bb95/0d82fd390e732f71d8320530994bfb6d2529.pdf)\\n\\nWe indeed had been notified about this issue by another cryptographer and had been preparing migration to the more secure CCM mode. Migration for this is now complete in all the Joplin clients and a migration tool has been added to the Encryption config screen of the desktop application. In particular you can perform two operations:\\n\\n- Upgrade the master key: This will convert the master key encryption to CCM\\n- Re-encryption: With this tool, you can re-encrypt all your data using the new encryption method based on CCM. Please follow the instructions on this screen and note that this process can take quite a bit of time so it\'s better to plan for it and run it over night. It is not entirely clear how the OBC2 flaw can be exploited but it is best to upgrade your data as soon as possible.\\n\\n### Unnecessary key expansions\\n\\n> I was looking through your encryption implementation for Joplin and I have a few comments and concerns.

The goal of this is to reduce brute-force attacks against user-chosen passwords. This function appears to me to be used for both password-based key derivation (at 10k rounds) *and* bulk encryption of data from a randomly-generated \\"master key\\" (at 1k rounds). The bulk encryption does not need the password expansion since the key is randomly generated (presumably with a cryptographically strong generator). I suspect this could be a major performance issue on the bulk encryption of raw data, so if you\'re finding encryption slow, this is maybe why.\\n\\nThis is more a performance than a security issue. Indeed, the previous encryption method was using 1,000 key expansion iterations every time a note was encrypted, which is unnecessary since the master key is already secured with 10,000 iterations. As a result the encryption algorithm has been changed to perform only 100 iterations when encrypting notes, which should result in faster encryption and decryption on the desktop, mobile and CLI applications.\\n\\n### Unnecessary and potentially insecure master key checksum\\n\\n> I was looking through your encryption implementation for Joplin and I have a few comments and concerns.

Thought I\'d mention it anyway. [Source](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/61915/can-i-hash-a-secret-key-and-used-the-hash-as-key-id). At least with CCM mode (and I think with OCB2) it shouldn\'t successfully decrypt if you have the wrong password.\\n\\nA checksum was previously stored with the master key to verify that it is valid. This could potentially weaken the security of the mater key since, as mentioned in Cryptography StackExchange link, \\"in the standard model of hash functions there isn\'t a requirement that hash outputs not have properties that leak information about the input\\". It was also unnecessary since the decryption algorithm in use would fail if the key is invalid, so the additional checksum was not needed.\\n\\nThis has also been addressed by the new master key upgrading tool. If you have performed the upgrade, the checksum will be gone from your master key.\\n\\n### Encrypting local secrets with a keychain service\\n\\n> I was looking through your encryption implementation for Joplin and I have a few comments and concerns.

The generally accepted approach [to store secrets] is to use a keychain service, which is available pretty much on all modern platforms.\\n\\nPasswords are indeed cached locally, so that you don\'t have to input it again every time a note needs to be encrypted or decrypted for synchronisation. It is assumed that your local device is secure, which is why for now passwords were cached locally.\\n\\nTo improve security however, future versions of Joplin will use the system keychain whenever it is available. A [pull request](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/2861) is in progress to add this feature.\\n\\nTo conclude I\'d like to thank Isaac Potoczny-Jones for conducting this audit and revealing these potential security issues.

Joplin already includes robust HTML-to-MD and MD-to-HTML conversion modules (battle tested respectively in the web clipper and the desktop/mobile client), and this new editor is based on this technology. It is possible however that there are various edge cases that I have not thought of.\\n\\nThus your support to test and validate (or invalidate) this idea would be very much appreciated! If it turns out it does not make sense technically to support this editor, for example if some bugs are critical and can\'t be solved, it might be removed at a later date, but hopefully all bugs will be fixable. **Please report issues you might find on GitHub,** [**on this post**](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/176). In there, there\'s also a list of features that remains to be implemented.\\n\\nAt the moment, the feature is a bit hidden. **To enable it, go into the menu View =&gt; Layout button sequence, and choose \\"Split / WYSIWYG\\"**. Then click on the Layout button to toggle between modes.\\n\\n**Missing features**\\n\\nSome features are missing, most notably the ability to insert plugin blocks such as Katex or Mermaid, so you would have to create them first in the split view. Once created, they can however be edited.\\n\\nOne issue to be aware of, one that cannot be easily fixed, is that **some Markdown plugins are not supported by the editor**. This is because once the Markdown is converted to HTML, and displayed in the WYSIWYG editor, it cannot be converted back to the original Markdown. Some plugins are supported, such as Katex, Fountain or Mermaid. But others are not, like the multi-md table. So if you open a note that contains a multi-md table in the WYSIWYG editor and save, the original multi-md Markdown will be lost, and you\'ll get back a plain Markdown table.\\n\\nAgain if you find any issue, please report it on GitHub: [https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/176](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/176)\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20200314-001555_1.gif)"},{"id":"/20200301-125055","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/20200301-125055","editUrl":"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/tree/dev/readme/news/20200301-125055.md","source":"@site/news/20200301-125055.md","title":"Large desktop update coming soon","description":"I haven\'t kept up with releases lately and thus the new one is quite big, it includes 8 new features, 3 security fixes, 19 improvements, and 29 bug fixes.

The application period as organisation is expected to happen in the second half of January 2020. Until then Joplin hopes to have multiple active discussion and may even have some easy commits in regard to the application and potential projects.\\n\\nFor those who don\u2019t know, GSoC is a summer internship sponsored by Google, where **open source organisations get full-time students as interns** (paid by Google) to help take care of tasks. It\u2019s a huge boon to many open source projects, allowing potentially some impressive progress to take place, and therefore many organisations try to qualify.\\n\\nIn order to apply, we\'d need:\\n\\n- **A list of good task suggestions for students**. These tasks need to be things that can be realistically done by someone working full-time over a single summer. Students can suggest other tasks, but we are going to provide some suggestions.\\n- **People volunteering to mentor a student.** Mentoring requires continuous communication and contact with the student, as well as responding to requests and questions. I\u2019ve mentored in the past, and it\u2019s a fun experience.\\n\\nFell free to make a suggestion or offer support by creating topics in the [Features category](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/c/features) of the forum and tagging them by **#GSoC** and **#2020**, if it is directly related to the upcoming coding season. More details on how to contribute will be published soon.\\n\\nIn general, Google wants to know that its money is put to good use, so we, as the Joplin community, need to show active involvement in this, leading to a solid schedule of desired deliverables during the coding phase.\\n\\nThe GSoC application is managed by **@PackElend**. He is an open source enthusiast with a big believe in a fair economy. He has recognised that Joplin has the potential to become one of the best note taking apps, and he sees the GSoC has a great opportunity to bring certain essential features to Joplin. PackElend mentored students in the past for another project and thus is aware of the pitfalls. He would appreciate if he could get support in giving the documentation the final touch."},{"id":"/20191117-183855","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/20191117-183855","editUrl":"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/tree/dev/readme/news/20191117-183855.md","source":"@site/news/20191117-183855.md","title":"And the winner is...","description":"After much discussion and votes and new logo and icon for Joplin has finally been decided: In the end, it is an icon relatively similar to the previous one but with a unique style for the \\"J\\", whic...","date":"2019-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 17, 2019","tags":[],"readingTime":1.19,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"created":"2019-11-17T18:38:55.000Z","source_url":"https://www.patreon.com/posts/and-winner-is-31636650","sidebar_label":"And the winner is...","date":"2019-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","title":"And the winner is...","description":"After much discussion and votes and new logo and icon for Joplin has finally been decided: In the end, it is an icon relatively similar to the previous one but with a unique style for the \\"J\\", whic...","image":"https://joplinapp.org/images/news/20191117-183855_0.png"},"prevItem":{"title":"Joplin is looking into joining Google Summer of Code in 2020","permalink":"/news/20191118-072700"},"nextItem":{"title":"Hacktoberfest 2019 has now ended \ud83c\udf83","permalink":"/news/20191101-131852"}},"content":"<div className=\\"donate-links\\">\\n\\n[![Donate using PayPal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/badges/Donate-PayPal-green.svg)](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?business=E8JMYD2LQ8MMA&no_recurring=0&item_name=I+rely+on+donations+to+maintain+and+improve+the+Joplin+open+source+project.+Thank+you+for+your+help+-+it+makes+a+difference%21&currency_code=EUR) [![Sponsor on GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/badges/GitHub-Badge.svg)](https://github.com/sponsors/laurent22/) [![Become a patron](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/badges/Patreon-Badge.svg)](https://www.patreon.com/joplin) [![Donate using IBAN](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/badges/Donate-IBAN.svg)](https://joplinapp.org/donate/#donations)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\nAfter much discussion and votes and new logo and icon for Joplin has finally been decided:\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20191117-183855_0.png)\\n\\nIn the end, it is an icon relatively similar to the previous one but with a unique style for the \\"J\\", which gives it a distinctive look.\\n\\nPerhaps that\'s the best way - evolving and cleaning up the icon rather than radically changing it. Another advantage of this icon is that it does not represent any specific object (it\'s not a note, or notebook), so it does not restrict the scope of the project, which as it grows, is becoming more than just a tool to take notes.\\n\\nFinally, this icon scales well at different sizes, including down to 16x16 pixels which we need for tray icons. It also works well inside circles (for Android) and square shapes.\\n\\nOver the next few weeks, the icon and logo will be updated in the various apps and websites. That will give an opportunity to refresh the icons used throughout the apps, as several of them have incorrect dimensions, in particular on desktop and Android.\\n\\nFor information, this was the final tally, with Patreon and forum votes combined, with more weight (2 points) given to the first choice:\\n\\nA 30\\n\\nB 45\\n\\nC 115\\n\\nD 135\\n\\nE 61\\n\\nMany thanks to everyone who\'s contributed to the votes and discussion!"},{"id":"/20191101-131852","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/20191101-131852","editUrl":"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/tree/dev/readme/news/20191101-131852.md","source":"@site/news/20191101-131852.md","title":"Hacktoberfest 2019 has now ended \ud83c\udf83","description":"We got lots of great contributions for Hacktoberfest 2019, including: 48 pull requests opened 39 pull requests merged This year, one small issue is that we got 11 \\"spam\\" contributions, as in pull r...","date":"2019-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 1, 2019","tags":[],"readingTime":0.85,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"created":"2019-11-01T13:18:52.000Z","source_url":"https://www.patreon.com/posts/hacktoberfest-31221846","sidebar_label":"Hacktoberfest 2019 has now ended \ud83c\udf83","date":"2019-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Hacktoberfest 2019 has now ended \ud83c\udf83","description":"We got lots of great contributions for Hacktoberfest 2019, including: 48 pull requests opened 39 pull requests merged This year, one small issue is that we got 11 \\"spam\\" contributions, as in pull r..."},"prevItem":{"title":"And the winner is...","permalink":"/news/20191117-183855"},"nextItem":{"title":"New Joplin icon, second round","permalink":"/news/20191014-155136"}},"content":"<div className=\\"donate-links\\">\\n\\n[![Donate using PayPal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/badges/Donate-PayPal-green.svg)](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?business=E8JMYD2LQ8MMA&no_recurring=0&item_name=I+rely+on+donations+to+maintain+and+improve+the+Joplin+open+source+project.+Thank+you+for+your+help+-+it+makes+a+difference%21&currency_code=EUR) [![Sponsor on GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/badges/GitHub-Badge.svg)](https://github.com/sponsors/laurent22/) [![Become a patron](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/badges/Patreon-Badge.svg)](https://www.patreon.com/joplin) [![Donate using IBAN](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/badges/Donate-IBAN.svg)](https://joplinapp.org/donate/#donations)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\nWe got lots of great contributions for Hacktoberfest 2019, including:\\n\\n- 48 pull requests opened\\n- 39 pull requests merged\\n\\nThis year, one small issue is that we got 11 \\"spam\\" contributions, as in pull requests that are created only as a way to get a the Hacktoberfest T-shirt.

The applications (desktop, mobile and CLI) now preserve previous versions of the notes, so you can inspect or restore them later on as needed.\\n\\nA common complain with many sync-based note taking apps is that they work in an opaque way - sometimes notes are changed or they disappear and it\'s not clear why - it could be a user error, or some bug, but regardless it makes it hard to trust the app with thousands of notes. So this feature give transparency over what\'s happening - if some note seems to be gone or changed when it shouldn\'t, the redundant data allows investigating the issue and restoring content.\\n\\nAnother medium term goal is to allow the implementation of a recycle bin. Behind the scene, this is essentially already done since whenever a note is deleted, a final revision of that note is preserved. What\'s missing is a user interface (i.e. the recycle bin) to view these deleted notes.\\n\\n### How does it work?\\n\\nAll the apps save a version of the modified notes every 10 minutes. These revisions are then synced across all the devices so if you\'re looking for a particular version of a note that was made on mobile, you can later find that version on the desktop app too.\\n\\n### How to view the history of a note?\\n\\nWhile all the apps save revisions, currently only the desktop one allow viewing these revisions.\\n\\nTo do so, click on the Information icon in the toolbar, then select \\"Previous version of this note\\".\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20190523-221026_0.png)\\n\\nThe next screen will show the latest version of the note. You can then choose to view a different version, if any, or to restore one of them.\\n\\nTo restore a note, simply click on the \\"Restore\\" button. The old version of the note will be copied in a folder called \\"Restored Notes\\". The current version of the note will not be replaced or modified.\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20190523-221026_1.png)\\n\\n### How to configure the note history feature?\\n\\nAdditional options are available in the \\"Note History\\" section of the configuration screen. It is possible to enable/disable the note history feature. It is also possible to specify for how long the history of a note should be kept (by default, for 90 days).\\n\\nIMPORTANT: Please note that since all the revisions are synced across all devices, it means these settings are kind of global. So for example, if on one device you set it to keep revisions for 30 days, and on another to 100 days, the revisions older than 30 days will be deleted, and then this deletion will be synced. So in practice it means revisions are kept for whatever is the minimum number of days as set on any of the devices. In that particular case, the 100 days setting will be essentially ignored, and only the 30 days one will apply."},{"id":"/20190424-102410","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/20190424-102410","editUrl":"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/tree/dev/readme/news/20190424-102410.md","source":"@site/news/20190424-102410.md","title":"The Joplin forum is one year old","description":"Exactly one year ago, on 24 April 2018, the Joplin forum was created as a result of this post on GitHub.

Before this, the only way to discuss the project was indeed on the GitHub bug tracker, which is not ideal for general discussion about features, development and so on.\\n\\nAfter looking at various options, eventually we settled on Discourse, which provides a nice clean UI, works well on mobile, and is easy to manage. Even better, the Discourse team was kind enough to host the project for us for free, as part of their [Free hosting program for open source projects](https://blog.discourse.org/2016/03/free-discourse-forum-hosting-for-community-friendly-github-projects/). Not having to manage or pay for the server is great, and it means more time can be spent developing the application.\\n\\nOn the opening day, there was only three users - me, foxmask and zblesk, joined a few days later by tessus, merlinuwe, jhf2442, sciurius and many others. Today there are 811 users, 6700 posts, about 15 new posts created each day, and about 2000 pageviews each day.\\n\\nThe forum has been very useful to discuss features and development, to provide support and news, and to organise [events such as Hacktoberfest](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/joplin-and-hacktobertfest-2018/752).

It is also built on top of SQLite FTS and thus support [all its queries](https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/search). Unlike the previous search engine, the new one also sorts the results by relevance.\\n\\nThe first iteration of this new search engine was a bit limited when it comes to non-English text. For example, for searching text that contains accents or non-alphabetical characters. So in the last update, better support for this was also added - accentuated and non-accentuated characters are treated in the same way, and languages like Russian, Chinese, Japanese or Korean can be searched easily.\\n\\nThis search engine is still new so it is likely to change over time. For example, ordering the results by relevance is a bit experimental, and some edge cases might not work for non-English language queries. If you notice any issue, feel free to report it on the forum or GitHub. The new search engine is in use in both the mobile and desktop application.\\n\\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20190130-230218_0.png)"},{"id":"/20181213-173459","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/20181213-173459","editUrl":"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/tree/dev/readme/news/20181213-173459.md","source":"@site/news/20181213-173459.md","title":"Joplin is now featured on PrivacyTools.io","description":"Joplin is now featured on PrivacyTools.io, a site dedicated to providing knowledge and tools to protect people\'s privacy against global mass surveillance.

Setting up Joplin synchronisation can be more complicated than other existing note applications, but the advantage is that once it is done you 100% own the data and even the infrastructure if you use Nextcloud on your own server.\\n\\nThe applications do not track users, and of course there is not and will never be ads. It also makes very few web requests (outside of synchronisation). In fact only two requests are made, and both can be disabled in the options:\\n\\n- One for geolocation tagging, to associate a latitude and longitude with a note.\\n\\n- One for the auto-update checks. It makes a request to GitHub to check if a new version has been released.\\n\\nThis endorsement by PrivacyTools is great news for the project. It means more users, and that our efforts to create a privacy-respecting tool are going in the right direction."},{"id":"/20181101-174335","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/20181101-174335","editUrl":"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/tree/dev/readme/news/20181101-174335.md","source":"@site/news/20181101-174335.md","title":"Hacktoberfest has now ended","description":"Hacktoberfest has now ended - many thanks to all those who have contributed.

However it eventually catches up, as is the case with the latest release, which includes all the features and bug fixes from the past few months.\\n\\nIn particular a feature that\'s been needed for a while - the ability to open resources (eg. PDF files or other attachments) in external viewers. That means all that\'s available in desktop - notes and attachments - is now also fully available on mobile, making the app much more useful. In this release there are also quite a few optimisations to the sync process so in some cases it should be faster, as well as better support for WebDAV. Finally there are various small fixes and improvements, such as support for SVG vector graphics, improved math formula support, etc.\\n\\nAll these improvements are also found in the recently released macOS, Windows, Linux and Android versions."},{"id":"/20180621-172112","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/20180621-172112","editUrl":"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/tree/dev/readme/news/20180621-172112.md","source":"@site/news/20180621-172112.md","title":"Web Clipper now available on Firefox and Chrome","description":"One of the most requested feature, the Web Clipper, is now available on the Firefox and Chrome store.

It is possible to save a whole web page, or a simplified version of it, or a screenshot directly from the browser to Joplin. Like the rest of Joplin, the HTML page will be converted to Markdown, which means it can be easily edited and read even without a special viewer, and, since it\'s plain text, it also makes it easier to search and share the content.\\n\\nHave a look at the [Web Clipper documentation](https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/clipper) for more information.\\n\\n![](https://joplinapp.org/images/WebExtensionScreenshot.png)"}]}')}}]);
